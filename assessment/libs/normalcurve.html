normalcurve(mu, sigma, a, b, [axislabel, x, dirx, y, diry, color, width, height])
<BR>draws a normal curve with mean mu and standard deviation sigma
<BR>This function is good for a basic normal curve, vertically scaled to fit
<BR>with axis labels at multiples of sigma
<BR>
<BR>draws on bounds a&lt;x&lt;b, with axis markings at mu+k*sigma
<BR>axis label gives an axis label
<BR>optionally can shade a region based on one or two values x and y
<BR>indiciate shade direction using dirx and diry, which can be "left" or "right"
<BR>you set use null for y to set later values
<BR>color indicates color of the shaded regions
<BR>width and height are pixels for the displayed graph.  defaults to 400 by 150
<BR><h3><a name="normalcurve2">normalcurve2</a></h3>
normalcurve2(mu, sigma, a, b, [axisspacing, ymax, axislabel, x, dirx, y, diry, color, width, height])
<BR>draws a normal curve with mean mu and standard deviation sigma
<BR>This function allows for axis spacing other than multiples of sigma, and does
<BR>not scale the graph vertically to fit.
<BR>
<BR>draws on bounds a&lt;x&lt;b
<BR>specify axisspacing, or defaults to sigma
<BR>set ymax to set max of vertical axis, or "auto" for ymax to autoscale
<BR>axis label gives an axis label
<BR>optionally can shade a region based on one or two values x and y
<BR>indiciate shade direction using dirx and diry, which can be "left" or "right"
<BR>you set use null for y to set later values
<BR>color indicates color of the shaded regions
<BR>width and height are pixels for the displayed graph.  defaults to 400 by 150
<BR><h3><a name="normalcurve3">normalcurve3</a></h3>
normalcurve3(mu, sigma, a, b, [axislabel, x, dirx, y, diry, color, q, dirw, r, dirr, color, width, height])
<BR>draws a normal curve with mean mu and standard deviation sigma
<BR>This function is good for a basic normal curve, vertically scaled to fit
<BR>with axis labels at multiples of sigma.  This versions allows for the shading
<BR>of TWO regions with different colors
<BR>
<BR>draws on bounds a&lt;x&lt;b, with axis markings at mu+k*sigma
<BR>axis label gives an axis label
<BR>optionally can shade a region based on one or two values x and y
<BR>indiciate shade direction using dirx and diry, which can be "left" or "right"
<BR>optionally can shade a second region based on one or two values q and r
<BR>indiciate shade direction using dirq and dirr, which can be "left" or "right"
<BR>you set use null for y, q, and/or r to set later values
<BR>color indicates color of the shaded regions
<BR>width and height are pixels for the displayed graph.  defaults to 400 by 150
