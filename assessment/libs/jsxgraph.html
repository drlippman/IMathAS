  <h1>jsxgraph Macro Library</h1>
  <p>JSXGraph Integration functions - Version 1.1</br>by David Flenner</p><p>Written: October 14th, 2020</p><p>Last Updated: January 30th, 2021</p>
  <p style="font-size:12px"><i>Adapted from JSXG library written by Grant Sander</i></p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This library provides an interface to the mathematics graphics library <a href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/index.html">JSXGraph</a> 
	for	iMathAS systems such as MyOpenMath. To use the library, you must first call the function: </p>
	<pre>loadlibrary("jsxgraph")</pre>
	<p>	Then you must create a "board" that you will add objects on. You create	a board through a call like:</p>
	<pre>$board = jsxBoard("rectangular")</pre>
	<p>Where "rectangular" indicates a standard cartesian coordinate grid. You can also create a "polar" grid, or a "geometry" board that is blank.
	Once you create the board, you can start adding objects to the board. To add an object, you make a call such as:</p>
	<pre>$a = jsxPoint($board, [1, 2])</pre>
	<p>Where $board is the variable name of the board you created, $a is a reference to the point you are making and [1, 2] are the coordinates of the point. 
	Every object you create can take a number of different options that you can control: color, size, dashes, etc. This is done by passing
	an optional associative array to the end of your function call. For instance:</p> <pre>$b = jsxPoint($board, [-1, 2], ["color" => "blue"])</pre>
	<p> This will make a second point on the board that will be blue. See the documentation below for the types of options you can control for each object</p>
	<p>Another feature of this library is the ability for these objects to interact with each other. You can use the reference variable in the creation
	of other objects. For instance, you could write:</p> <pre>$c = jsxCircle($board, [$a, $b])</pre><p>This would make a circle that passes through the
	points $a and $b. The really cool thing is that now if you move points $a or $b on your board, the circle will adjust accordingly!
	You can even use functions like: $a.X(), or $a.Y() if you want to reference the individual components of the point. 
	For instance:</p><pre>$f = jsxFunction($board, "(x - $a.X()) * (x - $b.X()))")</pre><p>will create a parabolic graph whose zeros are located at
	the x-values of points $a and $b, and will automatically adjust every time point $a or $b is moved!</p>
	<p>To label your objects, this library allows the use of either static or dynamic labeling. If you want to label an object, simply 
	pass the label text as an option:</p>
	<pre>$p = jsxPoint($board, [1, 2], ['label' => 'A'])</pre>
	<p>This will create a point with the label text 'A' attached to it and as you move the point, the label will follow. If you want to
	customize the label, you can change the 'fontcolor' and the 'fontsize' through $options. All labels	support ASCII math, and that can 
	be enabled by surrounding your text with ``:</p>
	<pre>$p = jsxPoint($board, [1, 2], ['label' => '`pi`'])</pre>
	<p>Alternatively, you can use rendering hints to make your labels display in ASCII math, just pass your label as an array with the first
	element containing your label, and the next element containing the word: 'display'. This will wrap your label in back-ticks for you. 
	Another rendering hint you can use is 'makepretty', this will attempt to clean up things like 1*x^2 = x^2 or 0*x+2 = 2 in your functions
	for nicer display. Test this extensively with your function as the regular expressions cleaning these can be buggy with different kinds
	of functions, but should work fine with polynomials, exponentials, and basic elementary functions.</p>
	<pre>$a = jsxFunction($board, "x+$a", ['label' => ["'y = x+' + $a.Value()", 'makepretty', 'display']])</pre>
	<p>If you need to express the derivative of a function, it is best to write f prime (x) in your ASCII Math because writing f'(x) can 
	confuse the system since ' is used to start and end a string</p>
	<p>You can also	create dynamic labels by using references to jsx objects in conjunction with javascript. To reference an object 
	during creation, use the keyword 'this'. For instance, the following code will create a point that is labeled with its coordinates:</p>
	<pre>$p = jsxPoint($board, [1, 2], ['label' => "'(' + this.X().toFixed(2) + ', ' + this.Y().toFixed(2) + ')'"])</pre>
	This is obviously more of an advanced feature, but the library is written with the ability to keep things simple, but allow the 
	extensibility of advanced constructs so the user can take full advantage of the power of JSX Graph.</p>
	<p>Lastly, for grading, you can pass important aspects to an answerbox, and all the library needs to know is the question number in the assignment - and
	the answerbox number if you happen to be using a multipart question.</p><p>You can easily pass the question number through the variable [$thisq] that is
	defined for all questions in an assessment. If you pass: ["answerbox" => [thisq]] for a point object, then you will see the 
	coordinates of the point show up in the answerbox for this question. You can then grab this data from the answerbox to check an answer.
	</p><p>I hope you find this library useful and easy to use. I've included a lot of example code below to give you ideas on how to use it. If you create a 
	question using it, please tag the question with #jsx in the name of the question so its easy for everyone to be able to find these great
	interactive questions!
</p>
   <h3>Notes:</h3>
   <ul>
	 <li>When the question type is set to <i>conditional</i> using the old interface, the board can revert to a smaller size after the submit button is pressed. This can 
		be avoided if the question text is longer than the board display. That prevents the board from being re-drawn in a smaller size.</li>

  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsxBoard">jsxBoard($type, <i>[$options]</i>)</a></h2>
  <p>This function creates a jsx board that allows you to add jsx objects on to. You then display the graph in the question text by 
	adding the $board where you would like the graph to display. The board <i>$type</i> must be specified as one of:</p>
  <ul>
	<li><i>rectangular</i> - a standard cartesian coordinate system is drawn on the board</li>
	<li><i>polar</i> - a polar coordinate grid will be drawn on the board</li>
	<li><i>geometry</i> - no grid is drawn</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additional optional items can be specified through an associative array:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>size</i> [(float) width, (float) height] - sets the width/height of the board in pixels. Note that the size of
		polar graphs must be square, so these only use the provided width</li>
    <li><i>navbar</i> (boolean) - include navigation buttons</li>
	<li><i>zoom</i> (boolean) - allow for zooming</li>
	<li><i>pan</i> (boolean) - allow for panning</li> 
	<li><i>centered</i> (boolean) - centers the board on screen if set to true, otherwise the board left-justified</li>
	<li><i>bounds</i> [(float) xmin, (float) xmax, (float) ymin, (float) ymax] sets the min/max coordinate bounds for the axes. These are
		ignored in polar graphs.</li>
    <li><i>title</i> a short description for screenreaders</li>
    <li><i>description</i> a long description for screenreaders</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following options are used with rectangular boards:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>axislabel</i> [(string) xLabel, (string) yLabel] - adds labels to the axes, ASCIIMath can be used</li>
    <li><i>ticksdistance</i> [(float) ticksDistanceX, (float) ticksDistanceY] sets the distance between each major tick on the axes</li>
    <li><i>minorticks</i> [(int) minorTicksX, (int) minorTicksY] sets the number of minor ticks between each major tick on the axes</li>
	<li><i>showlabels</i> [(boolean) showLabelsX, (boolean) showLabelsY] - turns on or off the axis grid labels</li>
	<li><i>gridheight</i> [(int) gridHeightX, (int) gridHeightY] - set the length of the major grid lines in the x and y direction. By default
		these are set to -1, which draws grid lines that span the entire board.</li>
	<li><i>minortickheight</i> [(int) minorTickHeightX, (int) minorTickHeightY] - set the length of the minor ticks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following options are used with polar boards:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>padtop</i> (boolean) - true adds some space to the top of the board to add sliders</li>
    <li><i>r</i> - [(float) max, (float) increment] - sets the max/increment for the radius ticks. Defaults to [5, 1]</li>
	<li><i>theta</i> - [(string) type, (float) increment] sets the type and increment of the theta grid components.<br/>
		The values of <i>type</i> can be:
		<ul>
			<li><i>degrees</i> - Sets up the grid in degree measure, <i>increment</i> is value in degrees</li>
			<li><i>radians</i> - Sets up the grid in radian measure, <i>increment</i> is a value in radians</li>
			<li><i>pi</i> - Sets the grid to fractions of pi, <i>increment</i> is the divisor for pi, such as pi/6</li>
			<li><i>custom</i> - Sets the grid to take <i>increment</i> units to complete a full rotation</li>
		</ul>
  </ul>
  <p>The return of this function is a set of javascript code necessary to display your board, in order to add objects to your board
	you need to pass this variable to all of your following calls to functions like jsxPoint in order to add additional javascript
	code to your drawing.</p>
  <h4>Rectangular Example</h4>
  <pre>
loadlibrary("jsxgraph")
$ops = [ "size" => [300, 300], "bounds" => [-3,7,-5,5], "axislabel" => ["`x`","`y=x^2`"]]
$board = jsxBoard('rectangular', $ops)
  </pre>
    <h4>Polar Example</h4>
  <pre>
loadlibrary("jsxgraph")
$ops = ['size' => [400, 400], 'padtop' => true, 'r' => [7,1], 'theta' => ['pi',6], 'pan' => false ]
$board = jsxBoard('polar', $ops)
  </pre>

  <!-- jsxSlider -->
  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsxSlider">jsxSlider($board, [$min, $max, $step, <i>$defaultval</i>], <i>[$options]</i>)</a></h2>
  <p>A slider is like a variable that a user can control the value of on screen. The necessary input values are the minimum value for the
    variable, the maximum value, and what increment each change to the slider has on the value of the variable. The function returns a reference
	object to the slider that can be used in other parts of your construction to make interactive elements. $defaultval is an optional
	parameter and can be used to set the starting position of the slider, if it is omitted then the default value is the midrange.</p>
  <p>An additional associative array can be provided to have further control over the look and feel of the slider</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>position</i> [[(float) x1, (float) y1], [(float) x2, (float) y2]] - sets the position of the slider on the board with starting coordinates
		of (x1, y1), and ending at (x2, y2). By default, sliders are just placed in the upper left-hand corner of the board. Sliders are fixed
		in such a way that their position is unaffected by zoom and pans. If the position is directly set, then zoom and pans will affect the 
		position of the slider.</li>
	<li><i>decimals</i> (integer) - The number of decimals to use for the display of the value.</li>
	<li><i>name</i> (string) - A text label for the slider, easier to use than the <i>label</i> below, but labels give more control.</li>
    <li><i>label</i> (string) - A textual string label for the slider, which will display next to the slider value, ASCIIMath can be used</li>
    <li><i>color</i> (string) - A value indicating the color of the slider ('red', 'green', etc.), an RGB/RGBA value encoded in hexadecimal, or
		a value such as rbga(45, 45, 45, 28)</li>
    <li><i>fontsize</i> (integer) - Affects the font size of the label text.</li>
	<li><i>fontcolor</i> (string) - The color for the label text</li>
	<li><i>answerbox</i> [$thisq, (optional) partNumber] - Places the value the a slider in an answerbox. This will look like: [$thisq] or [$thisq, n] for a multipart question
		where n is the box number to use.</li>
	<li><i>attributes</i> (json) - A json object encoded as a string that contains the value of any additional attributes you can modify from the jsxgraph API.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additional JavaScript functions that can be used in JSX constructions and labels:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>.Value() - the numeric value of the slider</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: If you set the <i>$step</i> value to be less than 1, you will need to adjust the value of <i>$decimals</i> in order to display these value.</p>
  <h4>Example 1</h4>
  <pre>
loadlibrary("jsxgraph")
$board = jsxBoard("rectangular")
$a = jsxSlider($board, [0, 10, 1], ['answerbox' => [$thisq], 'color' => 'blue'])
  </pre>
   <h4>Example 2</h4>
  <pre>
loadlibrary("jsxgraph")
$board = jsxBoard("rectangular")
$ops = ['answerbox' => [$thisq], 'position' => [[-4, -4], [1, -4]], 'color' => '#935218', 'decimals' => 1, 'name' => "a", 'fontsize' => 20, 'attributes' => '{ face: "cross" }']
$a = jsxSlider($board, [-15, 10, 0.1, 8], $ops)
  </pre>
   <h4>Example 3</h4>
  <pre>
loadlibrary("jsxgraph")
$board = jsxBoard("rectangular")
$a = jsxSlider($board, [-10, 10, 0.1], ['label' => "'a =' + this.Value().toFixed(1)",  'decimals' => 1])
$f = jsxFunction($board, "($a) * (x-3)*(x+1)")
  </pre>

  <!-- jsxPoint -->
  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsxPoint">jsxPoint($board, [$x $y], <i>[$options]</i>)</a></h2>
  <p>Adds a point to a $board, which is a variable returned from jsxBoard(). The initial location of the point must be provided as
	an array of two numbers, or as a string containing a function or a reference to another jsx object. The location of the point can be 
	linked to an answerbox and updated as the user moves the point around. The return of the function is a reference to this point contained
	within a string. This reference can be used to link the point to other objects. You can reference the entire point with a variable such
	as $p, or individual components as $p.X(), or $p.Y().</p>
  <p>$options is an associative array containing name/value pairs for the options. The options are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>fixed</i> (boolean) - makes the point immovable</li>
    <li><i>color</i> (string) - A value indicating the color of the point ('red', 'green', etc.) an RGB/RGBA value encoded in hexadecimal, or
		a value such as rbga(45, 45, 45, 28)</li>
    <li><i>size</i> (int) - sets the size of the point, defaults to 2</li>
    <li><i>face</i> (string) - sets the face of the point, defaults to "circle". Options are: cross, circle, square, plus, diamond, triangleup, 
		triangledown, triangleleft, triangleright</li>

	<li><i>visible</i> (boolean) - makes the point visible or invisible, useful in creating other objects</li>
	<li><i>trace</i> (boolean) - If set to true, the point will leave a trail of points on the board as it is moved. The trace points
		can be erased by pressing the 'o' button on the navigation panel.</li>
	<li><i>xsnapsize</i> (float) - forces the point to snap to specified intervals in the x-direction</li>
	<li><i>ysnapsize</i> (float) - forces the point to snap to specified intervals in the y-direction</li>	
	<li><i>answerbox</i> [$thisq, (optional) partNumber] - Places the value the a slider in an answerbox. This will look like: [$thisq] or [$thisq, n] for a multipart question
		where n is the box number to use.</li>
	<li><i>attributes</i> (json) - A json object encoded as a string that contains the value of any additional attributes you can modify from the jsxgraph API.</li>

  <ul>
	<li>.X() - the x-coordinate of the point</li>
	<li>.Y() - the y-coordinate of the point</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: For easier grading you can either set question type to N-Tuple, or use the function jsx_getCoords() to help read the coordinates from the answerbox.</p>
  <h4>Example 1</h4>
  <pre>
loadlibrary("jsxgraph")
$board = jsxBoard('rectangular', ['pan' => false])
$a = jsxSlider($board, [-3, 3, 1])

  </pre>

  <!-- Glider -->
  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsxGlider">jsxGlider($board, [[$x, $y], $obj], <i>[$options]</i>)</a></h2>
  <p>Attaches a point to another object that has already been created, and restricts the movement of the point to this object. The input variable 
	$board should be a reference to a board returned by jsxBoard(). The input location will adjust if the coordinates [$x, $y] does not 
	appear on the curve of $obj, so choosing an $x value of where you want the point to start is generally sufficient. $obj must be a reference 
	returned by another objected created by jsxgraph. Functions, parametric functions, polar graphs, circles, lines, polygons, etc. are all types 
	of curves that a Glider can be attached to. The return is a reference to the glider object such as $g, which can be used as a reference
	in the creation of other objects. You can also reference its individual components with calls such as $g.X() or $g.Y().</p>
  <p><i>$options</i> is an associative array containing name/value pairs for the options. The options are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>color</i> (string) - A value indicating the color of the point ('red', 'green', etc.) an RGB/RGBA value encoded in hexadecimal, or

	<li>.X() - the x-coordinate of the point</li>
	<li>.Y() - the y-coordinate of the point</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Note: For easier grading you can either set question type to N-Tuple, or use the function jsx_getCoords() to help read the coordinates from the answerbox.</p>

$c = jsxCircle($board, [[0, 0], 2], ['visible' => false])
$p = jsxGlider($board, [[0, -2], $c], ['label'=>"A", 'color' => 'blue', 'trace' => true]) 
  </pre>

  <!-- jsxIntersection -->
  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsxIntersection">jsxIntersection($board, [$obj1 $obj2], <i>[$options]</i>)</a></h2>
  <p>Creates an intersection point between two lines, two circles, or a circle and a line. If a circle is used, then only one
    intersection point will be found, but you can choose which one is found through the parameter 'negativeroot'. By default,
	jsxgraph will find the one that results in a positive square root when it is locating the intersection. $bj1 and $obj2 are

  <p>Adds the graph of a function to a jsx $board, which is a variable that must be returned from jsxBoard(). $f is the function to graph
	written as a string using common calculator notation. The return is a variable which is a string object reference to the function, which
	can be used in other parts of the construction.</p>
  <p><i>$options</i> is an associative array containing name/value pairs for the options. The options are:</p>

  <p>Creates a Riemann sum trapped between a function and the x-axis, or between two different functions. The parameters 
	expected are passed in an array and are: an array containing the lower endpoint and upper endpoint of the interval and
	the number of rectangles to use. Each of these items can be numeric that will make them static. You can also use 
	references to other jsx objects in order to make them dynamic. The second parameter can be a single function in order to
	create rectangles between the x-axis and the function, or an array of functions which will draw the rectangles between the 
	functions. The return is an object reference that can be used in the creation of other jsx objects.</p>
  <p><i>$options</i> is an associative array containing name/value pairs for the options. The options are:</p>

  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsxSuspendUpdate">jsxSuspendUpdate($board)</a></h2>
  <p>Temporarily pauses all updates to a board object so that a lot of objects can be drawn more quickly. This is useful

  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsxUnsuspendUpdate">jsxUnsuspendUpdate($board)</a></h2>
  <p>Unpauses updates to a board object so that objects will become interactive again.</p>
  
  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsxSetChild">jsxSetChild($parentBoard, $childBoard)</a></h2>
  <p>Sets a relation between two boards so that changes to sliders/gliders in the parent board 
     trigger updates in the child board.  Note that the parent board needs to be displayed first to
     prevent errors.</p>


  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsx_getCoords">jsx_getCoords(string)</a></h2>
  <p>Takes a string that depicts a point and returns the x and y coordinates contained within, useful for grading questions
	based on the location of a jsx point.</p>
	
  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsx_getXCoord">jsx_getXCoord(string)</a></h2>
  <p>Takes a string that depicts a point and returns only the x coordinate of the point, useful for grading questions

  <h2><a style="color:blue" name="jsx_getYCoord">jsx_getYCoord(string)</a></h2>
  <p>Takes a string that depicts a point and returns only the y coordinate of the point, useful for grading questions
	based on the location of a jsx point.</p>

<h2>Advanced Examples</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates how to make dynamic aspects from items that may not seem obvious. JSX Graph supports making all items
	dynamic, but it isn't always useful. However, this library gives you the ability to take advantage of those advanced constructs
	but you must resort to more complex notation. For example here, I have tied the opacity attribute of a polygon to a slider, allowing
	me to change the opacity dynamically. This had to be accomplished by creating a wrapper function - which is a common construct in
	JSX dynamic objects - within a json parameter. Notice that within the construct I can call $a which is a reference to the slider, 
	but I have to call $a.Value() in order to get the value of the slider. This is the procedure in JSX graph, but in this library, I
	made it so you don't have to use the .Value() function to get the value of a slider for simplicity.</p>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<pre>
loadlibrary("jsxgraph")
$board = jsxBoard('rectangular')
$a = jsxSlider($board, [0, 1, 0.01], ['decimals' => 2])
$poly = jsxPolygon($board, [[1, 2], [-1, 3], [-3, 2]], ['attributes' => " { fillOpacity: function() { return $a.Value(); } } "])
$g = jsxGlider($board, [[0, 0], $poly])
</pre>
<p>The next example demonstrates how you can control the positioning of labels if the default position is not preferred. The
	easiest option is to use a text object for the label, rather than the objects' label because the positioning can easily
	be controlled through the anchor attribute.</p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<pre>
loadlibrary("jsxgraph")
$board = jsxBoard('rectangular')
$a = jsxPoint($board, [-3, -2])
$b = jsxPoint($board, [4, 1])
$midpoint = jsxPoint($board, ["($a.X() + $b.X()) / 2", "($a.Y() + $b.Y()) / 2"], ['visible' => false])
$line = jsxLine($board, [$a, $b])
$label = jsxText($board, [[0,0], "'slope = ' + $line.getSlope().toFixed(2)"], ['anchor' => "$midpoint"])
</pre>

<p>The next example is an example that utilizes grading within jsxgraph. The question type here is set to "Conditional".</p>
<h4>Example 3</h4>
<pre>
// Common Control:

loadlibrary("jsxgraph")
$anstypes = ["number"]
$board = jsxBoard("geometry", $ops)

$c = jsxCircle($board, [[1, -2], 2], ["fillcolor" => "red", "color" => "red"])
$p = jsxPoint($board, [0, 0], ["answerbox" => [$thisq, 0]])

$stu = getstuans($stuanswers, $thisq, 0)
if($stu == null) {
  $stu = -50 // Make a default answer
} else {
  $x, $y = jsx_getCoords($stu) // parse the x and y coordinates from the point
}

$dist = sqrt(($center[0] - $x)^2 + ($center[1] - $y)^2)
//print_r($dist)

$answer = ($dist < $radius)

// Question Text:
