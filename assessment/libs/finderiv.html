<h1>Macro Library finderiv</h1>
&nbsp;A library of Financial Derivative Functions. Version 1.0 Dec 27, 2020
<BR>&nbsp;Author: Daniel Brown: CU Boulder - Leeds School of Business
<BR><ul>
<p> The following library implements useful functionality for wrinting questions for 
financial derivatives. It includes forward prices, forward contracts and the Black-Scholes-Merton
model for European call and put options. </p>
<p>The question 606302 tests this macro library. If you make changes to the library please modify 
the test question to incorporate your changes and run to make sure that nothing is broken.</p>

<p>This function returns the payout of a portfolio. The portfolio can contain call options, put options,
forward contracts and zero-coupon bonds. The parameters are: </p>

<li><b>types</b> is an array where each element is 'call', 'put', 'forward' or 'bond'.</li>
<li><b>possizes</b> is an array of position sizes. It can be positive or negative. If the type is a zero-coupon bond 
then the position size is the amount paid at maturity.</li>
<li><b>strikes</b> is an array of strikes. These are the strikes for calls, puts and forward contracts. It is 
ignored if the type is a zero coupon bond.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="finderiv_fwdprice">finderiv_fwdprice(spot, rf, yield,  today, matdate, fmt)</a></h4>

<li><b>rf</b> is the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate.</li>
<li><b>yield</b> is the yield on the asset as a continuously compounded rate.</li>
<li><b>today</b> is today's date.</li>
<li><b>matdate</b> is the maturity date of the forward.</li>
<li><b>fmt</b> is the format of the date. It defaults to 'F j, Y'</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="finderiv_fwdpricediv">finderiv_fwdpricediv(spot, rf, div, divdays, today, divdate, matdate, fmt)</a></h4>
<p>This function calculates the fair forward price for a stock which pays a single dividend. 
The parameters are:</p>
<ul>

<li><b>rf</b> is the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate.</li>
<li><b>div</b> is the dividend amount.</li>
<li><b>today</b> is today's date.</li>
<li><b>divdate</b> is the dividend date for the dividend. If it is before the maturity of the forward then it 
is included in the calculation. If it is after, then it is ignored.</li>
<li><b>matdate</b> is the maturity date of the forward.</li>
<li><b>fmt</b> is the format of the date. It defaults to 'F j, Y'</li></ul>
<h4><a name="finderiv_fwdcontract">finderiv_fwdcontract(count, forward, strike, rf, today, matdate, fmt)</a></h4>
<p>This function finds the present value of a forward contract. The parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>count</b> is the number of units of the asset to be delivered in the contract. 
A positive number will return the present value of being long the contract (buying the asset) 
and a negative number will return the present value of being short the contract (selling the asset). </li>
<li><b>forward</b> is the fair forward price of the asset at the maturity of the contract.</li>
<li><b>strike</b> is the strike of the forward contract. This is the price at which one is 
buying or selling the asset.</li>
<li><b>rf</b> is the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate.</li>
<li><b>today</b> is today's date.</li>
<li><b>matdate</b> is the maturity date of the forward contract.</li>
<li><b>fmt</b> is the format of the date. It defaults to 'F j, Y'</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="finderiv_bsm">finderiv_bsm(type, strike, mat, today, spot, rf, vol, ans , fmt)</a></h4>

<p>This function calculates the value, delta, gamma or vega of a European call or put 
option using the Black-Scholes-Merton formulas. The parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>type</b> must be 'call' or 'put'.</li>
<li><b>strike</b> is the strike of the option.</li>
<li><b>mat</b> is the maturity date of the option.</li>
<li><b>today</b> is today's date.</li>
<li><b>spot</b> is the spot price of the asset. </li>
<li><b>rf</b> is the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate.</li>
<li><b>vol</b> is the volatility of the asset.</li>
<li><b>ans</b> is the answer type. It must be 'value', 'delta', 'gamma' or 'vega'.</li>
<li><b>fmt</b> is the format of the date. It defaults to 'F j, Y'</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="finderiv_immdate">finderiv_immdate(start, n, fmt)</a></h4>
<p>This function finds the nth IMM date after the start date. IMM dates are the 
third Wednesday of March, June, September and December. The parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>start</b> is the starting date. If it is an IMM date then n=1 will return the next one.</li>
<li><b>n</b> is the number of IMM dates after start date to return. It must be positive. </li>
<li><b>fmt</b> is the format of the date. It defaults to 'F j, Y'</li>
</ul>
