<h1>Macro Library sagecell</h1>
<p>Sagecell integration documentation, Version 1.0, Jan 2018</p>

<p>There is not need to actually load this macro library. This documentation
describes how to set up your HTML to enable SageCell integration.</p>

<p>For a basic SageCell that students can use for calculations, but for which
their work is NOT retained when they submit the question, you can put in your HTML
a <code>pre</code> tag with class <code>converttosagecell</code>, and put your
starting/default Sage code inside of it. Like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;pre class="converttosagecell"&gt;
  x = var('x')
  integral(sin(x), x)
&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you want to store the student's code so they can modify it and you can
view it, then you'll need to add an <code>essay</code> part to your question.
See the example below for an example of how you could set it up, 
including providing default Sage code</p>

<p>Question Type: Multipart.  Question Code:</p>
<pre>
$anstypes = "essay,numfunc"
$answeights = "0,1"
$scoremethod = "singlescore"
$a = rand(2,8)

$answer[1]= "-$a cos(x)"
</pre>

<p>Question text:</p>
<pre>
&lt;p&gt;Modify the Sagecell below to find the integral of `$a sin(x)`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="converttosagecell"&gt;
  $answerbox[0]
  &lt;pre class="hidden"&gt;
    x = var('x')
    integral(sin(x), x)
  &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: $answerbox[1]&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
