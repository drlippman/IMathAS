        At the Login page, you will be asked to supply your login credidentials (username and password).
        You will also be able to select Viewing/Accessibility options:
        <ul>
            <li>Most of the time, select Use defaults.  This will detect what your browser is capable of, and use the best option available.</li>
            <li>Force image-based display will force the use of images for math and graph display. This can be helpful if the default display is
                not working correctly for you, or if you want to be able to copy-and-paste math and graphs.</li>
            <li>MathJax display uses MathJax for math display, and detects the best settings for graphs.</li>
            <li>Use text-based display, for screen readers or older browsers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>If you're not sure what to choose:</b> Pick "Use defaults"</p>
        <p>
            The options are set for your current session only, so you can set them differently depending on the support offered by the
            computer you're currently working at.
