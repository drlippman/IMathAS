<h2>Purpose of this document</h2>
<p>This document contains information on administrating an IMathAS installation.  For
information on specific features, you might find more info in the <a href="../help.html">help file</a>.</p>

<h2>Administration Styles</h2>
<p>There are several ways in which you can administer an IMathAS installation:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Centralized course creation</b>:  An IMathAS administrator (full admin or group admin) creates courses and assigns them 
 to teachers with "Teacher" rights, who can't create their own classrooms.</li>
<li><b>Teacher-managed course creation</b>:  Instructors are given "Limited Course Creator" rights, allowing them to create 
 courses for themselves.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating Instructor Groups</h2>
<p>There is support in IMathAS for instructor/admin user Groups, usually intended to group instructors by discipline within
a college installation, or by college in a multi-college installation.  Group administrators can be set up to handle administration for
instructors within their group.
</p>
<p>Full Admins can create, change, or remove groups by clicking the "Edit Groups" link on the Admin page. </p> 

<h2>Adding Instructors</h2>
<p>
Instructors can be added manually, or you can use the "New instructor account request" page distributed with IMathAS to allow instructors
to request accounts themselves.
</p>
<p>
To add an instructor manaually, click the "Add New User" button at the bottom of the Admin page.
</p>
<p>
If you use the "New instructor account request" page, an email will be sent to the email address you provided when you installed IMathAS 
(the $sendfrom address) to notify you a request has been made.  From the group selection pulldown at the bottom of the Admin page, choose
"Pending" to list instructors who have made instructor account requests.  You can then change their rights to give them appropriate rights.
Be aware that if you are requiring email account confirmation for students, unconfirmed student accounts may also show up in the Pending list.
</p>

<h2>Creating Courses</h2>
<p>If the admin is creating courses for instructors, they can click the "Add new course" button to create a new course.  Once created,
use the "Transfer" link to transfer ownership to the intended instructor.</p>

<h2>Administator Access</h2>
<p>When accessing Manage Question Set from the Admin page, an administrator with Group Admin or Full Admin rights will 
be able to modify questions written by members of their group, or anyone for Full Admins.
</p>
<p>
Group Admins can list the courses of any of their group members (or anyone for Full Admins) and enter the course as an instructor 
to help with changes with the course</p>
