# OpenMath Application Setup
- Before starting this setup, make sure that you are using PHP 5.4 or above.
- MySql

#### Following are the steps to setup OpenMath application
 - Goto root directory of your machine.
 - For Windows user: C:/XAMPP/htdocs
 - For Linux user: /var/www (For Ubuntu 14.04 /var/www/html)
 - For Mac user: /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs
 - Take the clone of application from Github (git clone -b branch https://github.com/lumenlearning/IMathAS.git openmath).
 
##### Database Configuration
 - Edit the file config/db.php with real data, for example:
     
     - return [
     
      'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
     
      'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=imathasdb',
     
      'username' => 'root',
     
      'password' => '1234',
      
      'charset' => 'utf8',
      
     ];
     

##### Application Assets
 - Try to access  basic stack using url http://localhost/openmath/web, It will probably show you error with permissions.
 - Create assets directory in web (web/assets)
 - Give correct permissions to project directory
    - Command for linux and mac: sudo chmod -R 777 path/to/these/directory.(Note:Don't use 777 permissions on servers, just use it on your local machine).
    - Now again try to hit same url, It may show you error with cookie validations. 
    - To fix this you need to set value for cookieValidationKey  in config file located <project-root>/config/web.php.
    - Set some random alphanumeric key here.

           'request' => [
            // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
            
            'cookieValidationKey' => 'RqIC5VL10EWZYovFLgGbVYDtKTl73u7G',
            
      		'parsers' => [
      		
      				        'application/json' => 'yii\web\JsonParser',
      				        
        				]
        				
           ], 
           
##### Psysh Integration
 - Follow psysh installation instructions (http://psysh.org/#install)
 - In the console, type `psysh` to start a new shell prompt
 - Then copy and paste the code below in at the prompt
 
        require(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');
        require(__DIR__ . '/vendor/yiisoft/yii2/Yii.php');
 
        $config = require(__DIR__ . '/config/web.php');
        error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE);
        $app = new yii\web\Application($config);

           
  
           
 Thats it! Its all DONE and you are ready to go from here with OpenMath application.
