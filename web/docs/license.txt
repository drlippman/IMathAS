Questions written using the IMathAS language and macro libraries are 
NOT derivative works of this software, and therefore are not required

libraries or macro libraries using a license other than public-domain, 
specify the license in the library description.  Libraries distributed 
without a license statement will be assumed to be public-domain.  

It is my interpretation of the GPL (in the spirit of free software) that 
installers should not charge end-users (students) for access to IMathAS 
beyond reasonable hosting costs.
