</div>
<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="deletingcourse">Deleting</a></h3>

Clicking the &quot;Delete&quot; link after the course name will delete the course and
all items contained within the course.  However, it will not delete any
questions added to the Question Set from within the course; the Question Set
is shared, and not linked to any course


</div>
</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="questionsetmanagement">Question Set Management</a></h2>

<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="managequestionset">Manage Question Set</a></h3>

<p>Clicking the &quot;Manage Question Set&quot; link will allow you to search through the
Question Set, modify questions, add questions, remove question, transfer ownership, or
add a set of questions to a question library.  Only administrators or question owners 
have the rights to remove a question.  Be aware that if you remove
a question that is currently being used in an assessment (as shown in the &quot;Times
Used&quot; column), it will mess up that assessment.
</p>
<p>
The options available in the question set manager are:
<ul>
<li><b>Modify</b>: Change the source code of the question and make library assignments.  You will only see this option for
   questions you own or when the owner has given permission for anyone to modify the question.</li>
<li><b>View</b>:  View the source code of the question and make library assignements.  You will only see this option for question
   you do not own.</li>
<li><b>Template</b>:  Create a new question, using the code of an existing question as a starting point.  When you template a 
   question, the original question is not changed.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>:  Delete the question completely from the questionset and all libraries.  You will only see this option for
   questions you own or when the owner has given permission for anyone to modify the question.  You can delete many questions at once
   by selecting questions with the checkboxes, then clicking the Delete button near the top of the page.</li>
<li><b>Transfer</b>:  Transfer ownership of the question to another user.  You will only see this option for
   questions you own.  You can transfer many questions at once
   by selecting questions with the checkboxes, then clicking the Transfer button near the top of the page.</li>
<li><b>Library Assignment</b>:  The Library Assignment button near the top of the page can be used with the checkboxes to add or change your
   library assignments for the selected questions.  This will not affect other people's assignments</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Note that the assignment of questions into libraries can be done by anyone, but only the person who made the assignment is able
to remove the question from the assigned library</p>


</div>
<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="exportquestionset">Export Question Set</a></h3>

Use the &quot;Export Question Set&quot; feature to export a portion of the Question Set
for backup or sharing.  Use the search feature with the checkboxes to select
questions for inclusion in the export.  Clicking the &quot;Finalize&quot; button, you
will be asked for a Library Description.  


</div>
<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="importquestionset">Import Question Set</a></h3>
<p>
Use the &quot;Import Question Set&quot; feature to import a Question Set that you or
someone else had exported from IMathAS.  Be sure to only import question sets from
trusted sources.  After specifying an import file, you will be given a chance
to select specific questions from the set to be imported.  
</p>
<p>
Imported questions will have ownership assigned to the importer.  Select the
userights you want to apply to all imported questions.  You also can import
the questions directly into an existing or new question library</p>

<p>If any questions (identified by a unique id) already exist in your system, you
will be asked if you want to update the existing questions, or add as new questions.
If you have modified questions previously imported, you may want to add as new. </p>

</div>
</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="librarymanagement">Library Management</a></h2>
<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="managelibraries">Manage Libraries</a></h3>
<p>
Use the library manager to remove, rename, change rights, change parent, or transfer
ownership of question libraries.  Be aware that if a library is deleted, the
questions in that library will become unassigned; they are not deleted.
</p><p>
Libraries have a tree structure, where each library has a parent library.  When you
add or modify a library, you can change it's parent library.  If you change a library's
parent, all children library move with a library.  You can only specify an empty
library or existing parent library as a parent.
</p>
<p>
Libraries have use rights.  Options are:
<ul>
<li><b>Private</b>:  Only the owner or an administrator can list questions in these libraries</li>
<li><b>Closed to group, private to others</b>: Anyone in group can list and use questions, , but only 
	the owner or an admin can add questions to the library.  Hidden to anyone outside the group.</li>
<li><b>Open to group, private to others</b>: Anyone in group can list and use questions and add to the library.
	Hidden to anyone outside the group.</li>
<li><b>Closed to all</b>:  Everyone can list and use questions, but only the owner or an admin can add questions to the library</li>
<li><b>Open to group, close to others</b>: Anyone in group can list and use questions and add to the library.  
       Outside the group, users can only list and use questions; they cannot add questions to the library</li>
<li><b>Open to all</b>:  Everyone can list and use questions and add to the library</li>
</ul>
With library rights, child rights take precedence over parent rights.  For example,
if an open library is a child to a private library, the parent will not be hidden
from other users.  However a private library as child to a private parent will be
hidden from other users.
</p>
<p>Depending upon the system configuration, non-admins may be limited to creating libraries that are private
to others outside their group.  If this is the case, a non-admin will need to contact an admin to create a library
that is closed or open to all.</p>
<p>
Library assignments are done in question management.  Library assignments can be done
by any user, but only the person who made the assignment can remove that assignment.
</p>
</div>
<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="exportlibraries">Export Libraries</a></h3>
Use the &quot;Export Libraries&quot; feature to export an entire library or tree
of libraries for backup or sharing.  Use the tree to select libraries to export. 
Note that if a parent library is selected, it's children libraries are automatically 
included in the export, and heirarchy will be maintained. If libraries from different 
trees are selected, the topmost libraries in each branch selected will be exported 
at the same level.
</div>

<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="importlibraries">Import Libraries</a></h3>
<p>Use the &quot;Import Libraries&quot; feature to import an entire library or tree
of libraries.  After selecting a file, the tree of libraries in the import file
will be shown, and you can deselect libraries you do not want to import.  Note that 
if a parent library is not selected, NONE of the children libraries will be added, 
regardless of whether they're checked or not.</p>

<p>You will be asked if you want to update existing questions/libraries, or add as new.  If 
a library or question (identified by a unique id) in the import already exists on your system,
this will tell the importer whether to update the existing libraries/questions, or import
the libraries/questions as a new copy (a new unique id is assigned).
If you have modified questions previously imported, you may want to add as new. </p>

<p>
Imported libraries and questions will have ownership assigned to the importer.  Select the
userights you want to apply to all imported questions and libraries.  You can select
a parent in the library tree for all (top level) imported libraries</p>

<p>
If you load a file that does not have a library tree embedded in the file, you will
be told to use the Import Question Set feature instead.  Even if a file has a library
tree, you can use the Import Question Set feature to import specific questions from
the file.
</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="installmacrofile">Install Macro File</a></h2>
<p>A Macro Library contains macros (functions) which can be used in questions.  These
expand the capabilities of IMathAS.  If allowed, installation requires selecting the file name
from your local computer and clicking "Submit".  Be aware that any existing
macro library of the same name will be replaced.  A help file is automatically
generated for newly installed macro libraries.</p>
<p>
<b>Warning!</b>: Macro libraries are pure PHP (programming code), and have a large
security risk.  <b>Only install macro libraries from a trusted source</b>
</p>

</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="deleteoldusers">Delete Old Users</a></h2>

Use the Delete Old Users option to delete users who have not accessed the system within
some specified number of months.  You can delete just students, or all non-Admin users.

</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="importstudents">Import Students from File</a></h2>

Use the Import Students from File feature to register and enroll a set of students
automatically from a CSV (commas separated values) file.  You can generate a CSV
file using any spreadsheet program.

<p>
The form will guide you through specifying which columns of the CSV file contain
First name, Last name, email address, and desired username.  Once setting these options,
the first five rows of the file will be displayed so you can verify that the import
settings are correct.  If you selected a class to enroll the imported students in,
the students will be both registered and enrolled in that class upon submission.</p>

</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="managegroups">Manage Groups</a></h2>
<p>Groups allow instructors to be divided into groups (by school, for example).  Groups
can create group-specific libraries, and Group Admins can be assigned to have Admin 
rights over group users and libraries.  By default, users are added to a Default group.</p>

<p>Click <b>Edit Groups</b> to add, modify, or delete groups.</p>

</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="diagnostics">Diagnostics</a></h2>
<p>Diagnostics allow you to create a special login page for larger-scale diagnostic assessment. 
This provides a way for students to access and take the diagnostic without needing
to register and enroll in a course.  Also, it delivers them the correct assessment based
on a specified selection.</p>

<p>If you are a group admin or full admin, click the "Add New Diagnostic" button to set up
a new diagnostic.  Diagnostics are linked with assessments in a course, so you should first
create a course and add your diagnostic assessments to that course.</p>

<p>Over two pages, you will be asked for:
<ul>
 <li>Diagnostic name: the name of your diagnostic to display to students on the login page</li>
 <li>Term designator: Can be changed each term for ongoing assessments to keep track of which term an assessment was taken in.  Also will create a unique
   username for each term, so same student ID could take the assessment again in the different term.</li>
 <li>Linked with course:  What course contains your diagnostic assessments.  You must be listed as a teacher for the course</li>
 <li>Available:  Whether students can take the diagnostic</li>
 <li>Public:  Whether the diagnostic should be listed on the main Diagnostics list page at $imasroot/diag.  If set to no,
     students will have to be provided with the direct link to the diagnostic.</li>
 <li>Allow Reentry:  Whether students should be forced to complete the diagnostic in one sitting, or whether you'll allow them
     to reaccess the test at a later time.  If Yes, you can set a testing window that limits the number of minutes after first accessing
     the diagnostic they can reenter the diagnostic.</li>
 <li>Unique ID prompt:  How you want to word the prompt for a unique user id</li>
 <li>ID entry format:  Lets you specify the format of the unique ID, so ensure valid IDs</li>
 <li>Allow access IP addresses:  IP addressed for which the diagnostic can be taken without a password.  If you want to
     allow access from anywhere, enter "*".  You can use "*" for a wildcard as well, e.g. 123.45.* to allow any IP beginning
     with 123.45.</li>
 <li>Passwords:  Passwords which will allow access to the diagnostic from other IP addresses.  Passwords are not case sensitive.</li>
 <li>Super passwords:  These passwords will override the "allow reentry" time limit, if you specified one earlier.  These passwords would be intended 
     for use by instructors or proctors, and generally would not be shared directly with students.</li>
  <li>First level selector name:  Students will be asked to select two items from pull-down lists, with the values in the second
     depending upon the values in the first.  The choice in the first list also dictates which assessment is delivered.  For
     selector name, specify what this selection should be called, filling in the blank "Please enter your ______".  In many cases
     the two selectors will be Course and Instructor, or Course and Section</li>
 <li>First level selector options:  Add options for the first level selector</li>
 <li>Second level selector name:  Secondary selection, with values depending upon the first-level selector choice.  Fill in the blank
	"Enter your _________".  Second level selectors will be become the student's section identifier in the course, allowing you to
	use the tutor system with diagnostics.</li>
 <li>Deliver assessment:  For each first-level selector, specify which assessment should be delivered if the student
     selects that option</li>
 <li>Second level selector options:  For each first-level selector, specify the options for the second level selector.</li>
</ul>
<p>After submitting the second page, you will be provided with the direct access link to the diagnostic, which you can
provide to students or use to create a link from another website</p>

<p>In courses for which a diagnostic has been set up, the gradebook will display differently, showing the student unique ID, 
the term, and the first and second selector values in addition to the students' names and scores</p>

</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="managingadministrators">Managing Administrators and Teachers</a></h2>

At the bottom of the admin page is a list of users.  Group Admins will see the teachers in their group.  For Full Admins, 
teacher and higher level users are grouped by instructor Group, or are in the Default
group if you haven't defined groups.  Student accounts can be listed by choosing the corresponding first letter of the last name.  To approve
teachers who have filled out the "new instructor account request" form, choose Pending from the list.  Note that if you require email confirmation
of students, they might also show up in the Pending list until they confirm their account.

<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="addingadministrators">Adding Administrators and Teachers</a></h3>

You can add a new administrator, teacher, or student by clicking the &quot;Add New User&quot; 
button.  You will be asked to provide a username, user's name, and email.  The 
user's password defaults to 'password'.  If a user
already has self-registered, and you want to promote them to administrator or teacher,
find them in the user list and click the &quot;Change Rights&quot; link.

</div>
<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="rights">Rights</a></h3>

When adding a new administrator or changing rights, there are several rights levels, each

<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="assessments">Assessments</a></h3>

<b>Warning:</b> Making changes to an assessment after students have already taken it
can seriously mess up those students' assessment results.  It is NOT safe to change:  Default points per problem or Default penalty.


<div class=h4>
<h4><a name="assessmentsettings">Assessment Settings</a></h4>

You need to set the assessment settings when you add an assessment.  You can
change these settings by clicking the &quot;Modify Settings&quot; link next to the 
assessment in the course page.
<ul>
<li><b>Name</b>:  The name of the assessment</li>
<li><b>Summary</b>:  A description of the summary (shows on course page)</li>
<li><b>Intro/Instructions</b>:  Displays at the top of the test (see below for details on making question-specific instructions)</li>
<li><b>Available after</b>:  The first date for the item to be available to students</li>
<li><b>Available until</b>:  The last date for the item to be available to students.  Students must complete the assessment by this date - they will
    be kicked out if they are in the middle of an assessment when this time is reached.</li>
<li><b>Available for review</b>:  If the checkbox is clicked, the assessment will convert to review mode after the due date
    until this date.  Review mode defaults to Skip Around display, unlimited attempts, answers shown always.  Scores are not
    saved in Review mode.</li>
<li><b>Count</b>:  Whether the assessment score should be counted in the gradebook, not counted in the grade total, or counted as extra credit.</li>
<li><b>Copy Options From</b>:  If you have other assessments in your course already, you can select to copy the assessment settings
   from another assessment.</li>
<li><b>Password</b>:  If specified, requires student to enter this password to access the assessment.  Leave blank to require no password.</li>
<li><b>Time Limit</b>:  The time limit, in minutes, for the test (0 for none).  If the student exceeds the 
   time limit, their test will be recorded, and you can decide whether or not
   to accept it in the gradebook detail.  Partial minutes are possible using decimal values.  If you check the 
   "Kick student out at timelimit" box, then the assessment will automatically finalize at the timelimit, and submission
   attempts after the timelimit will be rejected.</li>
<li><b>Display method</b>:</li>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Full test at once</b>:  All questions are displayed on one page</li>
	<li><b>One question at a time</b>:  One question is shown at a time.  Students
	    must complete the questions in the order presented</li>
	<li><b>Full test, submit one at time</b>: Full test is displayed, but student submits
	    answer to one question at a time.  Student can skip between questions.</li>
	<li><b>Skip around</b>:  Students are provided with a navigation bar and can
	    jump between questions and complete them in any order</li>
	<li><b>Embedded</b>:  Similar to "Full test, submit one at time", but all questions are
	    always active, and any one can be submitted at any time.  Questions can be embedded into the 
	    Intro/Instructions using [QUESTION #] tags.</li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Default points per problem</b>:  How many points each problem should be worth by default.
    This can be changed for individual problems.</li>
<li><b>Default attempts per problem</b>:  How many attempts a student should have at each problem by default.
    This can be changed for individual problems.  Enter 0 for unlimited attempts</li>
<li><b>Reattempts different versions</b>:  Reattempting a problem will regenerate the question with new numbers.  By default,
    reattempts of problems receive the same version of the problem.  This option does not make sense to use with Homework mode.</li>
<li><b>Default penalty per missed attempt</b>:  What percentage of points possible a student should lose
    for an incorrect attempt.  This can be changed for individual problems.  You can select a penalty for
    each missed attempt, to start after a certain number of missed attempts, or specify a penalty for the last possible attempt only.</li>
<li><b>Feedback method</b>:  What detail the students should see</li>
	<ul>
	<li><b>No scores shown</b>:  No scores, including the total, are shown to the student.  If reattempts are allowed, 
	    the student is forced to retake all questions (even ones they got right the first time).  With this
	    mode, access to grade detail in the gradebook controlled by the Show Answers setting.</li>
	<li><b>Final score</b>:  Only final (total) score is shown at the end.  If reattempts are allowed, 
	    the student is forced to retake all questions (even ones they got right the first time).  With this
	    mode, access to grade detail in the gradebook controlled by the Show Answers setting.</li>
	<li><b>Show score on each at end</b>:  At the end of the test, the student is shown their score on 
	    each question.  If reattempts are allowed, they are then allowed to go back and reattempt
	    problems.</li>
	<li><b>Show as submitted</b>:  As each question is submitted, the score is shown, and students are 
	    offered a chance to reattempt the problem (if allowed).  This method does not apply to the
	    &quot;Full test at once&quot; display method.</li>
	<li><b>Practice Test</b>:  Same as above, and the test can be regenerated (re-randomized) whenever the student wants.  
	    Students are given an opportunity to try similar problems to
	    the one presented after completing each question (when not in Full test at once mode).  Scores are cleared each time
	    the test is regenerated, and scores are not shown by default in the gradebook.  Answers can be shown after some number
	    of attempts.</li>
	<li><b>Homework</b>:  Like "Show as submitted", but students are given an opportunity to attempt a similar
	    question if they miss a question.  Doing so resets attempts for that question (reseting attempt penalty as well).
	    Also, show answers (see below) can be set to show answers during the homework after a number of attempts.  This is
	    best used in conjunction with the attempt penalty.</li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Show Answers</b>:  When (if ever) students should be able to see answers.</li>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Practice Tests and Homework</b>:  For practice tests and homework, you can set this to never, after 0,1,3,4,or 5 attempts are made,
	    or after last attempt.  There is also an after last attempt option that will allow students to jump directly to the answer.</li>
	<li><b>Other Tests</b>:  For other tests, you can set this to never, after the assessment due date, after the last last attempt (in Skip Around and Full 
	    test submitted one at time modes only), or immediately.  
	    Answers will be available in the gradebook review of a test.  <i>Note</i>:  Do not use the "Immediately" option if you
	    are allowing multiple attempts per problem.  Doing so would allow a student to complete the test, view the answers, then
	    reenter the test (since more attempts are allowed) and put in the correct answers.  Also be aware that if an assessment
	    is set to allow review mode, that answers will be available to students in review mode.</li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Show hints when available</b>:  Whether or not to show hints if the question has them defined</li>
<li><b>Allow use of LatePasses</b>:  If you have granted LatePasses to students, this will allow use of them on this assessment</li>
<li><b>Make hard to print</b>:  Makes the assessment harder to print, for in-class tests</li>
<li><b>Shuffle item order</b>:  Randomizes the order in which questions are presented</li>
<li><b>Gradebook Category</b>:  If you have created gradebook categories, you can assign the assessment to one of those categories.</li>
<li><b>Count</b>:  Whether to count the assessment in the gradebook</li>
<li><b>Allow tutors to edit</b>:  Whether tutors should be able to change students' scores on this assessment</li>
<li><b>Minimum Score for Credit</b>:  A minimum score which must be acheived to receive credit for the assessment.  Set to 0 to accept all scores.
   If set and score is not met, gradebook will display "NC" (No Credit).</li>
<li><b>Show based on another assessment</b>:  Use this to hide this assessment until a specific score is acheived on another
  assessment.  Provide a point value and select an assessment to use this feature.  Set the assessment to "Don't Use" to not use
  this feature</li>
<li><b>All questions same random seed</b>: Usually not needed.  This is only need for a set of questions designed to work together using the same random values</li>
<li><b>All students receive same version of questions</b>:  All students receive the same first version of questions.  If in practice test or homework mode, when 
students request a similar problem, different students will receive different versions of the questions.</li>
<li><b>Penalty for questions done while in exception/LatePass</b>:  A percent penalty to take on all questions submitted after the original assignment due date while under a due date exception.</li>
<li><b>Is group assessment?</b>: Allows students to specify group members for the assignment.  All group members will receive the same score for the assignment</li>
<li><b>Show question categories?</b>:  If you plan to categorize questions and would like the categories displayed while the student is taking the test, you can
 select that option here</li>
<li><b>LTI access secret</b>:  An access code to place this assessment in a BasicLTI-compliant consumer.  <a href="#lti">More info</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Qustion-specific instructions</b></p>
<p>In the Intro/Instructions box, you can make question-specific instructions by putting a tag of the form [Q #] or [Q #-#] before the
text specific to that question or range of questions.  Here is an example:</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid #000;padding:8px;">
<p>This is the general info<p>
<p>[Q 1]</p>
<p>This text will display before question 1</p>
<p>[Q 3-4]</p>
<p>This text will display before questions 3 and 4.  Since there was no tag for question 2, it will display
  directly after question 1, with no associated intro text.  Likewise, if there was a question 5, it would 
  display directly after question 4 with no associated intro text.</p>
</div>

<div class=h4>
<h4><a name="addingquestionstoanassessment">Adding Questions to an Assessment</a></h4>

<p>You can add existing questions to an assessment by clicking the &quot;Select Library&quot; button 
to choose libraries to search, then the &quot;Search&quot; button to
list potential questions.  Leave the &quot;Search&quot; entry blank to list all questions in the libraries selected.  The checkboxes
can be used to search in all libraries (not just the selected ones), list only questions you own, or exclude questions you've already
added to your assessment.</p>
From this list you can:
<ul>
<li>Use the checkboxes to select questions, then click the &quot;Add Selected (using defaults)&quot;
button to add the questions.  Adding this way will use the assessment default settings for
points, attempts allowed, and penalty per attempt.  You can change these later by 
clicking the &quot;Change Settings&quot; link.</li>
<li>Use the checkboxes to select questions, then click the &quot;Add&quot;
button to add the questions.  Adding this way will allow you to override the default settings for
points, attempts allowed, and penalty per attempt if you wish, and add a question multiple times.</li>
<li>Click the &quot;Add&quot; link.  This will allow you to change the default
question settings</li>
<li>Click &quot;Use as template for New Question&quot; link.  This will create a new question based
upon the existing question.  This allows you to avoid rewriting a question from 
scratch if a similar question exists</li>
<li>Click &quot;Preview&quot; to preview the question</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, you can click the "Select from Assessments" button to choose questions from existing assessments.
In this mode, select the assessments you wish to pull questions from and click "Use these assessments".  Then select 
the questions you wish to use.</p>

Once added to the assessment you can:
<ul>
<li><b>Reorder Questions</b>: When "Rearrange Questions" is selected, using the number selectors next
    to each question will allow you to rearrange the order of the questions.  This is only useful if you
    are not shuffling the question order</li>
<li><b>Group Questions</b>:  When "Group Questions" is selected, using the number selectors next to each
    question will allow you to group questions.  When questions are grouped, the testing engine will randomly
    select one question from the group to display to the student</li>
<li><b>Change Settings</b>:  Override the default settings for points, attempts allowed, and 
    penalty per attempt, if desired</li>
<li><b>Edit Source</b>:  Change the question code or wording</li>
<li><b>Remove from assessment</b>:  Remove the question from the assessment.  This does not
    delete the question from the Question Set.  You can also use the checkboxes and the "With selected, Remove"
    button to remove multiple questions at once.</li>
</ul>

<div class=h5>
<h5><a name="questionintrotext">Adding an Introduction to a Question</a></h5>
<p>In addition to the assignment Introduction, each question can have an individual introduction.  A common example is to display a video and then a related question as part of a video assignment.</p>
<p>To add a question introduction, click on <span style="font-weight: bold">+ Text</span> below the last question.  An editable text box will appear where you can write instuctions or drag in a video link.  After you edit your text, click the <span class="mce-i-save" style="font-family: tinymce; font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Save All</span> icon in the editor toolbar.  You can expand/collapse each question intro by clicking the <span class="icon-pencil" style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Expand and Edit</span> or <span class="icon-shrink2" style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Collapse</span> icons in the lower right of the question intro.  Once you modify a question intro, you'll need to save it to collapse it.</p>
<p>When you click <span class="mce-i-save" style="font-family: tinymce; font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Save All</span>, all changes you have made in any other question intros will also be saved.  If you leave a question intro with unsaved changes, the Save All button will be highlighted.</p>
<p>A question intro can be displayed for multiple consecutive questions (except on Embedded assignments).  In the <span style="font-weight: bold">Show for</span> selector, select the number of questions that question intro should be used for.</p>
<p>Embedded assignments can include page titles.  Check the <span style="font-weight: bold">New Page</span> checkbox to add a page title. Then add your title in the editor and save it.</p>
<p>Below the last questions is an <span class="icon-enlarge2" style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Expand All</span> button which will expand all the question intros.  Click on any one to edit it.<p>
</div>

<p>If students have taken the assessment, you will not be allowed to make as many changes to the assessment, as it
will mess up existing student attempts.  If you need to change the assessment a lot, you can clear all student attempts.
Otherwise you can change individual question settings (be careful!) or edit the question if it's yours.  If there is a problem with
the question, you modify it, and want to give students another chance on that question, you can clear all attempts on a single question
by clicking the "Clear Attempts" link here</p>

<div class=h4>
<h4><a name="printcopies">Making Print Copies</a></h4>

<p>After adding questions to an assessment, click the &quot;Create Print Version&quot; to layout your assessment for printing.</p>

<p>On the first page, you will be asked what you would like to include in the test header.  You will also be asked to enter your
print margins setup.  These can be found by choosing "Page Setup" from the "File" menu in your browser.  In the Page Setup you may 
also wish to remove the default header and footer materials included in printouts by your browser.  </p>

<p>On the next page, you will see alternating blue and green rectangles indicating the size of pages. Use the resizing buttons 
next to each question to increase or decrease the space after each question until the questions fall nicely onto the pages. You 
can use Print Preview in your browser to verify that the print layout looks correct. After you have completed the print layout, 
you will be given the chance to specify additional print options.  Longer questions, such as those with graphs, may appear cut 
off in the print layout page. Be sure to resize those questions to show the entire question.</p>

<p>On the next page, select how many versions of the test you would like to generate, and whether you'd like to generate answer
keys.  After hitting continue, you print version of the test will be displayed.  Choose Print in your browser to print your tests.</p>

<li><b>Library Assignment</b>:  The Library Assignment button near the top of the page can be used with the checkboxes to add or change your
   library assignments for the selected questions.  This will not affect other people's assignments</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Note that the assignment of questions into libraries can be done by anyone, but only the person who made the assignment is able
to remove the question from the assigned library</p>

<h3><a name="exportquestionsetcm">Export Question Set</a></h3>

Use the &quot;Export Question Set&quot; feature to export a portion of the Question Set
for backup or sharing.  Use the search feature with the checkboxes to select
questions for inclusion in the export.  Clicking the &quot;Finalize&quot; button, you
will be asked for a Library Description.  


</div>
<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="importquestionsetcm">Import Question Set</a></h3>
<p>
Use the &quot;Import Question Set&quot; feature to import a Question Set that you or
someone else had exported from IMathAS.  Be sure to only import question sets from
trusted sources.  After specifying an import file, you will be given a chance
to select specific questions from the set to be imported.  
</p>
<p>
Imported questions will have ownership assigned to the importer.  Select the
userights you want to apply to all imported questions.  You can import
the questions directly into an existing library, or into the Unassigned library
for later assignment.</p>

<p>If any questions (identified by a unique id) already exist in your system, you
will be asked if you want to update the existing questions, or add as new questions.
If you have modified questions previously imported, you may want to add as new. </p>

</div>
</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="librarymanagementcm">Library Management</a></h2>
<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="managelibrariescm">Manage Libraries</a></h3>
<p>
Use the library manager to remove, rename, change rights, change parent, or transfer
ownership of question libraries.  Be aware that if a library is deleted, the
questions in that library will become unassigned; they are not deleted.
</p><p>
Libraries have a tree structure, where each library has a parent library.  When you
add or modify a library, you can change it's parent library.  If you change a library's
parent, all children library move with a library.  You can only specify an empty
library or existing parent library as a parent.
<p>
Libraries have use rights.  Options are:
<ul>
<li><b>Private</b>:  Only the owner or an administrator can list questions in these libraries</li>
<li><b>Closed to group, private to others</b>: Anyone in group can list and use questions, , but only 
	the owner or an admin can add questions to the library.  Hidden to anyone outside the group.</li>
<li><b>Open to group, private to others</b>: Anyone in group can list and use questions and add to the library.
	Hidden to anyone outside the group.</li>
<li><b>Closed to all</b>:  Everyone can list and use questions, but only the owner or an admin can add questions to the library</li>
<li><b>Open to group, close to others</b>: Anyone in group can list and use questions and add to the library.  
       Outside the group, users can only list and use questions; they cannot add questions to the library</li>
<li><b>Open to all</b>:  Everyone can list and use questions and add to the library</li>
</ul>
With library rights, child rights take precedence over parent rights.  For example,
if an open library is a child to a private library, the parent will not be hidden
from other users.  However a private library as child to a private parent will be
hidden from other users.
</p>
<p>Depending upon the system configuration, non-admins may be limited to creating libraries that are private
to others outside their group.  If this is the case, a non-admin will need to contact an admin to create a library
that is closed or open to all.</p>
<p>
Library assignments are done in question management.  Library assignments can be done
by any user, but only the person who made the assignment can remove that assignment.

<h3><a name="exportlibrariescm">Export Libraries</a></h3>
Use the &quot;Export Libraries&quot; feature to export an entire library or tree
of libraries for backup or sharing.  Use the tree to select libraries to export. 
Note that if a parent library is selected, it's children libraries are automatically 
included in the export, and heirarchy will be maintained. If libraries from different 
trees are selected, the topmost libraries in each branch selected will be exported 
at the same level.
</div>

<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="importlibrariescm">Import Libraries</a></h3>
<p>Use the &quot;Import Libraries&quot; feature to import an entire library or tree
of libraries.  After selecting a file, the tree of libraries in the import file
will be shown, and you can deselect libraries you do not want to import.  Note that 
if a parent library is not selected, NONE of the children libraries will be added, 
regardless of whether they're checked or not.</p>

<p>You will be asked if you want to update existing questions/libraries, or add as new.  If 
a library or question (identified by a unique id) in the import already exists on your system,
this will tell the importer whether to update the existing libraries/questions, or import
the libraries/questions as a new copy (a new unique id is assigned).
If you have modified questions previously imported, you may want to add as new. 
Note that only the original importer can update questions they imported.</p>

<p>
Imported libraries and questions will have ownership assigned to the importer.  Select the
userights you want to apply to all imported questions and libraries.  You can select
a parent in the library tree for all (top level) imported libraries</p>

<p>
If you load a file that does not have a library tree embedded in the file, you will
be told to use the Import Question Set feature instead.  Even if a file has a library
tree, you can use the Import Question Set feature to import specific questions from
the file.

assign a percentage weight to each category in calculation of total grade.</li>
<li>Gradebook display:  Select whether to order the gradebook by item dates (Available until dates for assessments, 
Show After dates for offline grades) or if you want to group items by category</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The next section lets you define categories.  There is always the "Default" category, but it will not display if there are no items
assigned to it.  To add a new category, click the "Add Category" link to add a new line to the table, then fill in the name and
other info, then click "Update"</p>
<p>For each category, you can specify:
<ul>
<li>Name:  The name of the category</li>
<li>Scale (optional):  Scale the category total by specifying a point value or percent value to be scaled up to 100%.  
For example, if the category point value was 80 points, and a student earned 50 points, their category total would be 50 points.
If you specified a scale of 60 points, then the students grade would become 80*(50/60) = 66.7 points out of 80.  You can specify whether
grades that would end up over 100% should be chopped to 100%.  You can specify no scale by leaving the Scale box blank.</li>
<li>Drops (optional):  You can specify whether to drop the lowest N scores, or keep the highest N scores from the category.  Set the number to 0 to keep all scores.</li>
<li>Weight/Fix Category Point Total:  If you are using a "Category Weights" grading scheme, enter the percent weights for each category 
here.  If the category percents don't add to 100%, they are all scaled equally so they do add to 100%.  If you are using a "Points earned" grading scheme, you can
fix the point value for the category here (optional).  For example, if the current category total is 50 points and a student earns 40 points, 
if you specified a fixed point value of 100 points, the students score would become 80 points.  Leave this blank to use the actual
category point total.</li>
<li>Remove:  When you remove a category, any items currently assigned to that category will be assigned to the Default category</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="mashups">Mashups: Google Gadget</a></h2>
<p>IMathAS has experimental support for two mashups: BasicLTI as a producer, and Google Gadgets</p>

<p>There is a Google Gadget which users can add to their iGoogle account available through
a link on the Change User Info page, accessible from the users' home page.  The gadget
will tell the user how many new messages and forum posts they have.</p>

<p>There is also a link from the Google Gadget page to a webpage that will report new
messages and posts without requiring you to log in.  This page is convenient on a mobile device.</p>
</div>
<div class=h2><h2><a name="lti">BasicLTI</a></h2>

<p>IMathAS can be used as a BasicLTI producer using two instructor-initiated placement methods: course level, or
assessment level.  A course level placement will provide access to an entire IMathAS course;  an assessment
level placement will allow you to provide access to a single assessment via LTI.  You can set the LTI
access secret through the Course Settings and Assessment Settings pages.  The URL and key to use are also provided on those
pages.  Follow the instructions in your LTI consumer to make the placement using the URL, key and secret.</p>

<p>Your LTI keys will take the form cid_###_# or aid_###_#.  The last number determines how authentication is handled.
If that last digit is 0, then when the student accesses the LTI placement, the first time they will be asked to sign into their
IMathAS account or create one, and that account will be linked with the account at the host LMS.  From then on, when the same 
student accesses any LTI placement, they will not need to sign in again.  They will be able to sign in directly to IMathAS as well.</p>

<p>If the last digit of your LTI key is 1, then a student account will automatically be created the first time a student 
accesses the LTI placement, and that account will be linked with the host LMS account.  The student will not be provided an IMathAS
username or password, so they will only be able to access IMathAS resources through the LMS LTI placements.</p>

<p>IMathAS can also be an LTI consumer.  In any text item, enter [LTI: url=theurl, key=thekey, secret=thesecret] to place a tool</p>

<h1><a name="writingquestions">Writing Questions</a></h1>

The IMathAS question format is based on PHP.

<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="questionparts">Question Parts</a></h2>

A question is formed in several parts:
<ul>
<li><b>Description</b>:  A description of the question.  This is not shown to students</li>
<li><b>Use Rights</b>:  The rights you wish to grant other people (you always have full rights).  Options are:</li>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Private</b>:  Only you can use the question</li>
	<li><b>Use, no modification</b>:  Anyone can use the problem, but only you can modify the problem.  Anyone can add 
	    library assignments, but cannot remove assignments.</li>
	<li><b>Use, allow modification</b>:  Anyone can use or modify the problem.</li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Libraries</b>:  The question libraries you wish to include this question in</li>
<li><b>Question type</b>:  The type of question.</li>
<li><b>Common control</b>:  General definitions needed for both display and scoring</li>
<li><b>Question control</b>:  Definitions only needed for question display</li>
<li><b>Question text</b>:  The actual question display.  This section should be HTML based, but
    can include variables defined in the common or question control.  For convenience, a blank line
    is automatically interpreted to be a paragraph break.  Use of &lt; and &gt; signs are usually 
    handled ok, but use of the HTML &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; are recommended in their place.</li>
<li><b>Answer</b>:  Code defining the answer</li>
</ul>

<p>Note:  All control code can be placed in the "Common Control" box; the Question Control and Answer sections do not have to be used.</p>

</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="basiccontrolsyntax">Basic Control Syntax</a></h2>
<p>
Lines of the common control, question control, and answer sections usually take the form of variable
definition.  In IMathAS, variables are identified with a dollarsign ($) prefix.  For example,
$a is the variable a.  Most lines will take one of these forms:
<ul>
<li>$var = number.  Example:  $a = 3</li>
<li>$var = calculation.  Example:  $a = 3*$b*$c</li>
<li>$var = function.  Example:  $a = showplot(&quot;sin(x)&quot;)</li>
<li>$var = randomizer.  Example:  $a = rand(-5,5)</li>
</ul>
In some cases you want to define several variables at once.  There are two ways to
do this:
<ul>
<li>$var1,$var2 = arrayfunction.  Example: $a,$b = diffrands(-5,5,2)</li>
<li>$ar = arrayfunction.  Example: $ar = diffrands(-5,5,2)</li>
</ul>
In the first example, variables $a and $b each take on a value.  In the second example,
the variable $ar is an array; the elements can be accessed as $ar[0] and $ar[1] (note
that arrays are zero-indexed).  If you use this approach, enclose the variable reference in
parenthesis in calculations, like $new = ($ar[0])^2, and in curly brackets inside strings, 
like $string = "there were {$ar[0]} people".
</p><p>
You can also literally define an array using the &quot;array&quot; function.  
Examples:  $ar = array(2,3,4,5), or $ar = array(&quot;red&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;)
</p><p>
Note that numbers are not in quotes, and strings are in quotes.  When you use
the double-quote mark (&quot;) to define a string, you can interpolate variables into
the string.  Example:
<pre>
$a = 3
$b = 5
$str = &quot;What is $a/$b&quot;
</pre>
In this example, $str now contains &quot;What is 3/5&quot;.
</p>
<p>If needed, you can concatenate (combine) two strings using the . operator.  Example:
<pre>
$a = &quot;string one &quot;
$b = &quot;string two&quot;
$both = $a . $b
</pre>
Here, $both now contains the string &quot;string one string two&quot;
</p>
<p>
If you have a long command to type, you can put a &quot;&amp;&quot; at the end of a line to specify it continues on the next line.  Example:
<pre>
$questions = array("this is choice 1",&amp;
"this is choice 2")
</pre>
If defining a string for display, you can put a &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; at the end of a line to specify it continues on the next line and insert
an HTML line break.  Example:
<pre>
$showanswer = "Do this first. &amp;&amp;
Then do this."
</pre>
will be interpreted as:
<pre>
$showanswer = "Do this first. &lt;br/&gt;Then do this."
</pre>
</p>
<div class=h4>
<h4><a name="conditionals">Conditionals</a></h4>

Any assignment line can be followed by one of two conditional:  &quot;where&quot; or &quot;if&quot;.  
<p>
&quot;where&quot; is used to repeat the previous assignment if the condition provided is not met.  The
&quot;where&quot; condition is almost exclusively used with array randomizers.  Example: to select two
different numbers that are not opposites:
<pre>$a,$b = diffrands(-5,5,2) where ($a+$b!=0)</pre>
<p>
&quot;if&quot; is used to make an assignment conditional.  For example:
<pre>
$a = rand(0,1)
$b = &quot;sin(x)&quot; if ($a==0)
$b = &quot;cos(x)&quot; if ($a==1)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Note the use of double equal signs (==) for testing equality.  A single equal sign (=) will
make an assignment (change the value of $a in this example) and return &quot;true&quot;, which is probably not what you intended to do.  
</p>
<p>
Comparison operators available for &quot;if&quot; and &quot;where&quot; statements:
<ul>
<li>==  Equal to</li>
<li>!=  Not equal to</li>
<li>&gt; Greater than</li>
<li>&lt; Less than</li>
<li>&gt;= Greater than or equal to</li>
<li>&lt;= Less than or equal to</li>
</ul>
To do compound conditionals, use || for &quot;or&quot;, and &amp;&amp; for &quot;and&quot;.  For example:
<pre>
$a = nonzerorand(-9,9) where ($a!=1 &amp;&amp; $a!=-1)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The &quot;if&quot; condition can also be used before or after a code block like this:
<pre>
$a = rand(0,1)
if ($a==0) {
   $b = 1
   $c = 2
}
</pre>
or 
<pre>
$a = rand(0,1)
{
   $b = 1
   $c = 2
} if ($a==0)
</pre>
When &quot;if&quot; is used before a block of code, it can optionally be followed
with &quot;elseif&quot; and/or an &quot;else&quot; statement, like this:
<pre>
$a = rand(0,5)
if ($a==0) {
   $b = 1
} elseif ($a==2) {
   $b = 3
} else {
   $b = 2
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
&quot;where&quot; can also be applied to a block of code:
<pre>
{ 
  $a = rand(-5,-1)
  $b = rand(1,5)
} where ($a+$b !==0)
</pre>
</p>
</div>
<div class=h4>
<h4><a name="loops">Loops</a></h4>
<p>There are several looping macros (such as calconarray) that can meet most needs.  For more general use
there is a "for" loop:</p>

<pre>for ($i=a..b) { action }</pre>
<p>
Here <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> represent whole numbers or variables.  Expressions are not allowed. 
</p>
<p>Examples:
<pre>
$f = 0
for ($i=1..5) { $f = $f + $i }

$a = rands(1,5,5)
$b = rands(1,5,5)
for ($i=0..4) {
  $c[$i] = $a[$i]*$b[$i] 
}
</pre></p>

<p>Conditions can be used <i>inside</i> a for loop, but not outside without explicit blocking
<pre>for ($i=1..5) {$a = $a+$i if ($i>2) }     WORKS
for ($i=1..5) {$a = $a+$i} if ($a>2)     DOES NOT WORK
{for ($i=1..5) {$a = $a+$i} } if ($a>2)    WORKS
</pre>
</p>
</div>

<li><b>showarrays(string,array,[string,array]...,[format])</b>:  Creates a tabular display of the data in the array(s) as column(s), with the strings
    as column headers.  format = "c", "r", or "l" to center, left-align, or right align data. Alternatively you can call this function with arguments
    showarrays(array of column headers, array of data arrays, [format]).</li>
<li><b>showdataarray(array,[columns])</b>:  Creates a tabular display of the data in the array with no headers.  Data is presented
    in one column unless second argument is provided, in which case the data will be distributed over the specified number of columns.</li>
<li><b>horizshowarrays(string,array,[string,array]...)</b>:  Creates a tabular display of the data in the array(s) as row(s), with the strings
    as row labels.  Does not text wrap, so only use for small data sets.</li> 
<li><b>showrecttable(data array of arrays,columnlabels,rowlabels,[format])</b>:  Creates a tabular display of a 2x2 data table, where $data[0] is the first row of the table.

		<li><b>color</b>: a color designator: black,red,orange,yellow,green,blue,purple</li>
		<li><b>min,max</b>: the min and max values for the input variable for which you wish to see this graph.  You can also exclude
		    point discontinuities; for example -5,5!0!2 for min,max would include all values from -5 to 5, excluding 0 and 2.</li>
		<li><b>startmarker,endmarker</b>: can be "open" or "closed" (dots), or anything else for none</li>

	</ul>
	</li>
<li><b>addlabelabs(plot,x,y,label,[color,loc,angle])</b>: Adds a label to a plot created with showplot. Parameters are the same as with

    plot created with showplot or other drawing tools.</li>
<li><b>showasciisvg(string,[width,height])</b>:  If you know the ASCIIsvg language, this will set up an svg with "string" as the script.
    optionally you can specify the width and height (in pixels) for the svg.</li>
<li><b>textonimage(img,text,left,top[text,left,top...])</b>:  Overlays text over an image.  Image can be a URL or the variable for an uploaded
    image.  Specify the text string, and offset in pixels from the top left corner.  Can specify multiple strings to overlay.</li>

  <li><b>gettwopointdata(stuans, type, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height])</b>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing question 
  and pulls out the two-point data for the given curve type.  Type should be one of 'line', 'parab', 'sqrt', 
  'sin', 'cos', 'abs', 'vector', 'circle'.  Returns an array of curve data, each of form array(x1,y1,x2,y2) giving the coordinates of 
  the two points used.  They are returned in the order clicked.  For example, with 'parab' type, the first point is the vertex and the 
  second point is an arbitrary point.</li>
<li><b>getdotsdata(stuans, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height])</b>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing
  question and pulls out the closed dots data.  Returns an array of dots, each of form array(x1,y1) giving the coordinates

<h2><a name="formatmacros">Format Macros</a></h2>

The following macros help with formatting values for display:
<ul>
<li><b>makepretty(string or array of strings)</b>: Changes double add/subtract signs to a single sign.</li>
<li><b>makeprettydisp(string or array of strings)</b>:  Does makepretty (see above) and backquotes the string for math display</li>
<li><b>polymakepretty and polymakeprettydisp</b>:  Like makepretty, but for polynomials.  Cleans up 0*, 1*, ^1, and ^0 to make the polynomial look nicer.  
   This function can do weird things for equations that are not simple polynomials, so test well</li>
<li><b>makexpretty and makexprettydisp</b>:  (deprecated - use makexxpretty instead) Like makepretty, but the X-tra version - attempts to clean up things like 1*, 0*, etc.  This function
   will often cause weird things to happen, so test well</li>
<li><b>makexxpretty and makexxprettydisp</b>:  Like makepretty, but the X-tra version - attempts to clean up things like 1*, 0*, x^1, x^0, etc.  Can occasionally cause strange output, so 
   be sure to test.  Handles things better than the older makexpretty, but does not always produce 100% identical output.</li>
<li><b>numtowords(number,[addth])</b>:  Creates a string containing number written out in words.  Add true as second parameter
    to change five to fifth.</li>
<li><b>numtoroman(number,[uppercase])</b>:  Converts a number 0.5-3999.5 to a roman numeral string.  Defaults to uppercase; set second parameter to false to
    produce lowercase</li>
<li><b>prettyint(number)</b>:  Adds commas in thousands spaces of integers.  Example: prettyint(1234) will return "1,234".  The result is a string, which
   can only be used for display, not in calculations</li>
<li><b>prettyreal(number,decimals,[comma])</b>:  Adds commas in thousands spaces of number, and rounds decimal to decimals places.  Example: prettyreal(1234.567,2) will return "1,234.57".  The result is a string, which
   can only be used for display, not in calculations.  By default adds a comma as a thousands separator; set comma to "" to override.</li> 
<li><b>prettysigfig(number,sigfigs,[comma,choptrailingzeros])</b>:  Rounds number to sigfigs significant figures.  By default it adds commas in thousands spaces; set comma to "" override.
   Set choptrailingzeros to true to chop trailing zeros from the decimal part, even if significant.</li> 
<li><b>makescinot(number,[decimals,format])</b>:  Converts number to scientific notation.  If provided, rounds mantissa to decimals places.  Can specify format: "*" "E" as alternative to default cross.</li>
<li><b>prettytime(value,informat,outformat)</b>:  Creates a nice representation of a time.  Informat can be 'h', 'm', or 's' designating whether
    value is hours, minutes, or seconds.  Outformat can be any combination of these to specify output.  For example, 'hm' will return "__ hours and __ minutes".  Outformat
    can also be 'clock' which returns 3:42pm, or 'sclock' which returns 3:42:15pm</li>
<li><b>dispreducedfraction(numerator,denominator,[doubleslash,variable in numerator])</b>:  Takes two numbers as numerator and denominator of a fraction, returning a display form of the fraction,
    reduced to lowest terms.  Suitable for $showanswer.  Set doubleslash to true to produced "3//4" rather than "3/4".  Set variable in numerator to put a variable
    in the numerator, such as pi.</li>
<li><b>makereducedfraction(numerator,denominator,[doubleslash,variable in numerator])</b>:  Same as dispreducefraction, but not already in display form</li>
<li><b>decimaltofraction(decimal,[format,maxden])</b>:  Converts a decimal to a fraction.  Can use format="mixednumber" to get a mixed number rather than improper fraction.  
    Only works for denominators up to maxden (default 5000)</li>
<li><b>htmldisp(string,[variables])</b>:  Uses HTML instead of the math typesetter to display simple exponents and subscripts, and to italicize variables</li>
</ul>

<li><b>sin(t), cos(t), tan(t), sec(t), csc(t), cot(t)</b>: The usual trig functions</li>
<li><b>arcsin(v), arccos(v), arctan(v)</b>: The inverse trig functions</li>
<li><b>abs(v)</b>: Absolute value</li>
<li><b>gcd(a,b)</b>: Greatest common divisor of a and b</li>
<li><b>lcm(a,b)</b>: Least common multiple of a and b</li>
<li><b>sign(a,[option])</b>:  Returns the sign of a, as 1 or -1.  If option is set to true, returns a string "+" or "-" instead. If option
  is set to "onlyneg", it returns the string "-" if a is negative, or "" otherwise.</li>
<li><b>v!</b>: Factorial, like $a = $b!</li>
<li><b>evalfunc(func,vars,val1,val2,..)</b>: Evaluates a function given the variables and values for each variable.
  for example evalfunc("x^2*y","x,y",2,3) will evaluate x^2*y with x=2, y=3</li>
<li>See also: calconarray and multicalconarray in the <a href="#arraymacros">Array Macros</a> section</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="conditionalmacros">Conditional Test Macros</a></h2>
These macros are used to test various conditions.  They typically return true or false, depending on whether the desired condition is met.
<ul>
<li><b>comparenumbers(a,b,[tol])</b>:  Compares numbers or numerical expressions a and b to see if there are equivalent to the specified
  tolerance.  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.</li>
<li><b>comparefunctions(a,b,[vars,tol,domain])</b>: Compares functions a and b to see if they are algebraically equivalent.  Set
  vars to a list of variables (defaults to 'x').  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.
  Set domain to "xmin,xmax" to specify a domain for comparison.</li>
<li><b>is_numeric(str)</b>:  Checks if the string represents an integer or decimal number.</li>
<li><b>scorestring($answer,$showanswer,words,$stuanswers,$thisq,[partn, highlight])</b>: This function checks
  to see if the words in the list/array "words" appear in the student's answer. If they all appear, it redefines
  $answer and $showanswer so the student's answer is marked correct. 
  For multipart questions, include the part number as an
  additional parameter.  Usage for single part questions (where $words is predefined earlier in the code):<br/>
  $answer,$showanswer = scorestring($answer,"",$words,$stuanswers,$thisq)<Br/>
  Usage for multipart questions (again where $words is predefined). This is example is for part 2: <br/>
  $answer,$showanswer = scorestring($answer,$showanswer,$words,$stuanswers,$thisq,2)
  </ul>
</div>
<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="feedbackmacros">Feedback Macros</a></h2>
These macros are used to select and format feedback messages to students.  They return a string which can be placed in the question text.
<ul>
<li><b>getfeedbackbasic(correct msg, incorrect msg, $thisq, [partnum])</b>:  Generates a feedback string based solely on whether the 
  question was scored correct or not.  Provide the correct and incorrect messages to display, and provide $thisq.  Give a part number for
  multipart questions to get part-based feedback.</li>
<li><b>getfeedbacktxt(stuans, feedbacktxt, ans)</b>:  Gives feedback on multiple choice questions.  <br/>
  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from
   $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart. <br/>
   feedbacktxt is an array of feedback responses, corresponding     in array order to the $questions, so feedbacktxt[1] is the feedback 
   if the student selections $questions[1] as their answer.  <br/>
   ans is the correct    answer; you can usually pass $answer if it's been defined already.</li>
<li><b>getfeedbacktxtessay(stuans, feedbacktxt)</b>:  Gives feedback on essay questions.  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from
   $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.  It is not actually evaluated or compared - it is only 
   needed to see if the student has entered a response or not.  Once the student has entered any response, feedbacktxt will be returned.</li>  
<li><b>getfeedbacktxtnumber(stuans, partialcredit, feedbacktxt, defaultfeedback, [tol])</b>:  Gives feedback on number questions.  <br/>
  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.  For Calculated
  type questions, be sure to use $stuanswersval.  <br/>
  partialcredit is an array or list of form array(number, score, number, score, ... ) where the scores are in the range [0,1].  <br/>
  feedbacktxt is an array of feedback messages, corresponding in array order to the order of the numbers in the partialcredit list.<br/>

  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.  <br>
  stuansval should be the numerical value of the student answer, obtained from $stuanswersval[$thisq]. <br/>
  partialcredit is an array or list of form array(number, score, number, score, ... ) where the scores are in the range [0,1].  <br/>
  feedbacktxt is an array of feedback messages, corresponding in array order to the order of the numbers in the partialcredit list.<br/>
  defaultfeedback is the default incorrect response feedback <br/>
  answerformat can be a single answerformat to apply to all expressions, or an array with each element applied to the corresponding expression<br/>
  requiretimes can be a single requiretimes to apply to all expressions, or an array with each element applied to the corresponding expression<br/>
  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.<br/>
  Example: <code>getfeedbacktxtcalculated($stuanswers[$thisq], $stuanswersval[$thisq], array("1/2",1,"1/2",.5), array("Correct", "Right value, but give your answer as a fraction"), "Incorrect", array("fraction",""))</code>
    will check the students answer against the answer "1/2" twice, the first time applying the "fraction" answerformat, and the second time not.</li>
<li><b>getfeedbacktxtnumfunc(stuans, partialcredit, feedbacktxt, defaultfeedback, [vars, requiretimes, tol, domain])</b>:  Gives feedback on numfunc (algebric expression/equation) questions.  <br/>
  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.<br/>

<h2><a name="solver">Solver</a></h2>
While writing a question, it can be handy to quickly solve a formula for a variable.  For example, if you're writing a question that asks students to solve y=($a x + $b)/($b x - $a) for x, where $a and $b are randomized variables.  You might need to calculate the correct answer.  The Solver tool can help solve or check the solution.
</div>
<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="solverinput">Solver Input</a></h3>
		Tips:
		<ul>
			<li>Select your code from the Common Control box, then either drag-drop or copy-paste it to the box below, or
			<li>Highlight an expression in Common Control and press <kbd>Ctrl-M</kbd> to update the Solver code, or
			<li>Highlight an expression in your code before clicking Solver.
			<li>Select an operation to perform: Solve, Differentiate, Integrate, Plot.
			<li>You may need to change the colored Sage code below to solve for the correct variable or to adjust the plot window etc.  See the help icon below for examples.
		</ul>
</div>
<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="solversage">Solver: Sage Syntax</a></h3>
		SageMath examples:
		<blockquote><code>

<h2><a name="writingcommon">Common options to all types</a></h2>
All question types can support these options:
<h4>Hints</h4>
<p>For a single question (not multipart), to use hints, in the common control (or question control) section define the array $hints where:
<pre>$hints[attempt number] = "hint text"</pre></p>

<p>For example:<pre>
$hints[0] = "This will show on first display"
$hints[1] = "This will show on second attempt (after 1 missed attempt)"
$hints[2] = "This will show on third and subsequent attempts, since no later values have been defined"
</pre>
It is fine, or example, to not define $hints[0] if you want nothing to display initially.
</p>
<p>
Then in the question text, place the location of the hint using the variable $hintloc.
<p>

<p>In multipart questions, you can follow the process above if you just want a single strand of hints for the entire problem.  If you want per-part hints, define the $hints array as:
<pre>
$hints[question part number][attempt number] = "hint text"
</pre>
Then in question text, place each hint using $hintloc[question part number]
</p>

<h4>Help references</h4>
<p>To provide help of some sort for a question (typically, links to videos, book references, etc), define $helptext
in the common control section.  Any text assigned to this variable will show above the answer box entry tips.  The
display of this text is controlled by the same "show hints?" option that controls the display of hints described above.</p>


<h4>Referencing Student Answers</h4>
<p>To create multipart questions that are graded on consistency, or to create a set of lab-type problems that rely on student-provided data, you can reference
students' previous answers in your question code.  You will only be able to reference the student answer to some question types</p>
<ul>
<li>$stuanswers[N] will refer to the student's answer on question N (not zero-indexed: N=1 is question 1)</li>
<li>$stuanswers[N][P] will refer to the student's answer on question N, part P (if multipart)</li>
<li>$stuanswers[$thisq][P] will refer to the student's answer on the current question, part P</li>
<li>$stuanswers[$thisq-1] will refer to the student's answer on the previous question</li>
<li>$stuanswersval[$thisq] or $stuanswersval[$thisq][P] will contain the numerical value of Calculated question types.</li>
</ul>
Notes (important!):
</p>
<p>
1) If the student has not answered the question, then $stuanswers[N] == null.  If used in an equation, it will take on the value 0.  To prevent divide-by-zero errors and to prevent students from exploiting this, it is highly recommended that you do something like:
<pre>
$a = $stuanswers[$thisq][0]
$a = rand(1,100) if ($a==null)
</pre>
Perhaps also include:
$warning = "You MUST answer question 1 before this question" if ($a==null), then put $warning in the question text.
</p>
<p>
2) If you use $stuanswers in your $answer, $showanswer will generally not be defined.  If you follow the advice in #1 above, then your 
$showanswer will reflect the random number assigned to $a.  For this reason, it is highly recommended that you custom define the $showanswer.
</p>
<p>
3) If using the $stuanswers array in a string or in the Question Text, you must enclose it with curly brackets:  
Your answer was {$stuanswers[0][0]}.  If using it directly in a calculation, enclose it in parentheses just to be safe.
</p>
<p>
4) $stuanswers[$thisq] is defined for question scoring, but may not be for question display.
</p>
<p>
5) You can use the function getstuans($stuanswers,N,P) to retreive a student answer value.  This method bypasses some strange things that happen
when there is a multipart question with only one part.
</p>

<h4>Other Reference Variables</h4>
<p>A few other special purpose variables can be referenced:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>$scorenonzero</b>: This variable is only available on display, not during scoring. $scorenonzero[$thisq] (or $scorenonzero[$thisq][partindex] for multipart)
   will be -1 if the question is unanswered, 0 if the score is zero, and 1 if the score is anything above 0.</li>
<li><b>$scoreiscorrect</b>: This variable is only available on display, not during scoring. $scoreiscorrect[$thisq] (or $scoreiscorrect[$thisq][partindex] for multipart)
   will be -1 if the question is unanswered, 1 if the score (before any penalties) is perfect, and 0 otherwise.</li>
<li><b>$attemptn</b>: This variable holds the attempt number of the current attempt.  0 is the initial attempt, 1 is the next attempt, etc.</li>
<li><b>$requestclearla</b>:  If you set $requestclearla=true in your code, it will request the display to clear out the student's last answer.
  This might be useful if your question branches based on attempt count.  Example: <code>$requestclearla = true if ($attemptn==2 &amp;&amp; !$scoreiscorrect[$thisq])</code></li>

<h4>Reusing Code</h4>
<p>You can import in the Common Control code from another question using
<pre>includecodefrom(questionid)</pre>
where questionid is the ID number of the question you want to import the code of.  In the
source question, the variable $included will automatically be set to true when the question
has been included, so it can be used to determine if the question has been
imported into another question, or is running independently.
</p>
<p>For example, in the master/source question, you might use the code:
<pre>
if (!$included) {
 $type = rand(0,4)
}
do stuff here
</pre>
In a question using this code, you could limit to a specific type using:
<pre>
$type = 0
includecodefrom(1234)
</pre>
</p>
<p>Question text can be also brought in from another question by using
<pre>includeqtextfrom(questionid)</pre>
somewhere in the Question Text portion of the question.

<h2><a name="questiontypes">Question Types</a></h2>

The question types available are:

<div class=h3>
<h3><a name="number">Number</a></h3>

The student is asked to enter a number (integer, decimal, or scientific notation).
The answer is compared to a given tolerance.  Can also accept DNE, oo (Infinity), and
-oo (Negative Infinity) as answers.

<p><b>Required Variables</b><BR>
<dl>
<dt>$answer = a number or calculation resulting in a number, like $answer = 5 </dt>
	<dd>Defines the answer.  Define multiple acceptable answers in a string separated by or:  $answer = "3 or 5 or 7".  
	Alternatively, you can provide an interval notation range of 
	acceptable answers, like $answer = "(2,5]".  Providing a range will override any tolerances set.  If $answerformat is set
	for list answers, then this should provide a list of correct answers, like $answer = "1,2,3".</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p><b>Optional Variables</b><BR>
<dl>
<dt>$reltolerance = a decimal value </dt>
	<dd>Defines the largest relative error that will be accepted.  If this is not set, a relative error of .001 (.1%) is
	used by default.</dd>
<dt>$abstolerance = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the largest absolute error that will be accepted.  This will override the use of $reltolerance</dd>
<dt>$reqdecimals = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the decimal accuracy required (ie 2 for two decimal places).  This will put a message in the answer tips stating the
	decimals required.  If neither $abstolerance or $reltolerance is set, this will set the tolerance, otherwise the provided tolerance
	will be used (even if it doesn't agree with the $reqdecimal setting).</dd>
<dt>$reqsigfigs = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the significant figure accuracy required.  Use $reqsigfigs = 2 for at least 2 sig fig accuracy, or
	$reqsigfigs = "=2" to require exactly 2 sig figs in the answer, or $reqsigfigs = "[2,3]" to require 2 or 3 sigfigs.  This will put also a message in the answer tips stating the
	significant figures required.  This overrides both $reltolerance and $abstolerance.  If you use the "=2" form, it will also 
	round your $answer if needed for the $showanswer.</dd>
<dt>$answerformat = "list", "exactlist", "orderedlist", "nosoln", or "nosolninf"</dt
	<dd>$answerformat = "list", "exactlist", or "orderedlist" specifies that a list of answers is expected.  If $answerformat="list", then duplicate values are ignored.  If $answerformat="exactlist",
	then duplicate values are not ignored.  If $answerformat="orderedlist", the list must be in the same order and contain identical counts of values.
	<br/>$answerformat = "nosoln" or "nosolninf" adds a list radio buttons for "no solutions" and optionally "infinite solutions". $ansprompt can override the default statements like this:
	$ansprompt = "One value, x=;No values;Many values"</dd>
<dt>$partialcredit = array(number,score,[number,score,...]) </dt>
	<dd>Allows you to specify partial credit for other answers.  The array should be given in the form array(number,score,number,score,...), where
	number is the value to compare to the student answer, and score is a proportion between 0 and 1 to award as partial credit.  Note this
	currently only works for single number answers; "or" and list answers are not supported.</dd>
<dt>$ansprompt = string </dt>
	<dd>A string that will be displayed in front of the input box.  Example: $ansprompt="y="</dd>
<dt>$displayformat = "alignright" </dt>
	<dd>Aligns the text in the answer box to the right side</dd>
<dt>$answerboxsize = number </dt>
	<dd>Determines the number of characters space provided for entry of an answer.  Defaults to 20.</dd>
<dt>$answerbox (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>Using the variable $answerbox in the Question Text will place the question input box in that location</dd>
<dt>$showanswer </dt>
	<dd>The answer to show to students (if option if available).  Defaults to $answer.  Use this to give a detailed answer,
	or a rounded off answer.</dd>
<dt>$hidetips = true </dt>
	<dd>Hides the question entry tips that display by default.
This should only be used when a question type is being used in an unintentional way,

<dt>$domain = "inputmin,inputmax" </dt>
	<dd>Defines the domain on which to compare the given answer and correct answer functions.  The same domain
	applies to all variables.  An option third list element "integers" can be given, which limits the domain to integer

	on equations that are near zero for most values of the input; this can often be overcome by changing the $domain<br/>
	"toconst": Specifies that the answer provided by the student is allowed to differ from the specified answer by a constant
	for all inputs.  Appropriate for comparing antiderivatives.  This may fail on expressions that evaluate to very large
	values or raise numbers to very large powers.</dd>
<dt>$reltolerance = a decimal value </dt>
	<dd>Defines the largest relative error that will be accepted.  If this is not set, a relative error of .001 (.1%) is

<dt>Question part variables</dt>
	<dd>For each question part, you will need to define the variables (like $answer, $questions, etc.) you would normally
	need to define.  However, you will need to suffix the variable with a part designator.  For example, based on $anstypes 
	above, the first answer is a number.  Instead of $answer = 5, enter $answer[0] = 5.  This designates that this answer belongs
	to the first element of $anstypes.  Likewise, to set the variables for the "numfunc" type, you'd set $variables[5] = "x".</dd>
<dt>$answerbox[partnum] (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>The array $answerbox will contain the entry boxes for each answer type.  In the question text, you will need to position

	$showanswer, which will be the only answer shown for the problem (ie, $showanswer = "x=$answer[0], y=$answer[1]")</dd>
<dt>$showanswerloc (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>Optionally, you can use $showanswerloc to place a single $showanswer "Show Answer" button,

<h3><a name="conditional">Conditional</a></h3>
A variation on multipart questions, a conditional question can include multiple answer boxes, but assigns

	<li><b>array('number',$a,$b)</b>:  Will compare the numbers or numerical expressions $a and $b and mark the question correct if they
	   are equivalent.  Can set $reltolerance or $abstolerance as needed, like with Number/Calculated type
	   questions</li>
	<li><b>Multiple comparisons</b>: You can mix the two types above by creating an array of comparions.  All must be true

<dt>Question part variables</dt>
	<dd>For each question part, you will need to define the variables (like $questions, etc.) you would normally
	need to define, except you <b>should not</b> define an $answer.  However, you will need to suffix the variable with
	a part designator.  For example, based on $anstypes

	This designates that this setting belongs
	to the first element of $anstypes.  
	</dd>
<dt>$answerbox[partnum] (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>The array $answerbox will contain the entry boxes for each answer type.  In the question text, you will need to position
	these boxes within the question.  For example:  "Enter a number: $answerbox[0].  Now a function: $answerbox[5]"</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Optional Variables</b><BR>
<dl>
<dt>Question part options</dt>
	<dd>You can define any optional variable for each question part.  Like above, suffix the variable with the part designator.
	Note that $variables, $domain, $reltolerance, and $abstolerance may be used for the comparison, and should not be set for 
	individual parts.</dd>
<dt>$showanswer</dt>
	<dd>By default the $showanswer for conditional types is "Answers may vary".  Set $showanswer to override this.</dd>

<div class=h2>
<h2><a name="takingassessments">Taking Assessments</a></h2>
When you take an assessment, it will be displayed to you in one of three ways:
<ul>
<li><b>Full Test</b>:  You may see the entire test at once</li>
<li><b>One at a time</b>:  You may have to answer one question before proceeding to the next</li>
<li><b>Full test, submit one at a time</b>:  The full test is displayed, but only question is available for answer entry at a time</li>
<li><b>Skip Around</b>:  You may see a green box on the left.  This will contain a list of questions.  You can
    skip around between questions by clicking on these links, and answer the questions in any order.</li>
</ul>

There are several question types.  At the bottom of the question or under the answer box when you click on it, it will tell you
what kind of answer is expected.  Here are the types:
<ul>
<li><b>Number</b>:  You will be asked to enter a number, like 3, 5.5, or -6</li>
<li><b>Calculated</b>:  You will be asked to enter a number, or a calculation, like 2/3, 5^2, or sin(2).  You can
    press the "Preview" button to ensure that the system is interpreting your answer the way you intended.</li>
<li><b>Multiple-Choice</b>:  You will be given a set of choices, and asked to select the correct choice</li>
<li><b>Multiple-Answer</b>:  You will be given a set of choices, and asked to select all the correct choices</li>
<li><b>Matching</b>:  You will be given a list of items with input boxes in front of them.  In each box, enter the letter
    of the item in the right-hand column that matches that item</li>
<li><b>Function</b>:  You will be asked to enter a function, like "sin(x)" or "3x^2-5" or "x^2/5".  Make sure you use the
    same variables in your answer than were specified in the question.  You can press the
    "Preview" button to ensure the system is interpreting your answer the way you intended.  It will also check to 
    make sure that it understands your answer, and will tell if you if the syntax is ok.</li>
<li><b>String</b>: You will be asked to enter a word or list of letters</li>
<li><b>Numerical Matrix</b>:  You will asked to enter a matrix of numbers.  In some case, a grid of input boxes will be provided
    for you to enter the values.  If not, you will need to enter the matrix in ASCIIMath notation, like [(1,2,3),(4,5,6)]
    for the 2x3 matrix with first row: 1,2,3</li>
<li><b>Calculated Matrix</b>:  Like a numerical matrix, but each entry can be a calculation, like 2/3 or 5^2 or sin(2).</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="enteringmath">Entering Math</a></h3>
For some types of questions, you need to enter a mathematical expression.  The system
follows order of operations, so use grouping symbols as much as necessary.
<p>Here is some help on how to enter expressions:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>* / + -</td><td>Multiply, divide, add, subtract</td></tr>
<tr><td>^</td><td>Powers.  2^3 = 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>sqrt</td><td>Square root.  sqrt(4) = 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>( )</td><td>Parentheses, for grouping.  (2+6)/2 = 4, while 2+6/2 = 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>e, pi</td><td>The standard constants</td></tr>
<tr><td>abs</td><td>Absolute Value.  abs(-4) = 4</td></tr>
<tr><td>sin,cos,tan,sec,csc,cot,sinh,cosh</td><td>Standard trig function.  Be sure to enter as sin(2), not sin 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>arcsin,arccos,arctan,arcsinh,arccosh</td><td>Inverse trig functions.  Note arcsec, arccsc, and arccot are not defined</td></tr>
<tr><td>sin^-1, cos^-1, tan^-1</td><td>Alternative entry for inverse trig functions.  Use like sin^-1(0.5)</td></tr>
<tr><td>ln</td><td>Natural Logarithm base e</td></tr>
<tr><td>log</td><td>Common Logarithm base 10</td></tr>
<tr><td>!</td><td>Factorial</td></tr>
<tr><td>oo</td><td>Infinity.  Those are two lowercase o's, like the middle of the word "look"</td></tr>
