</div> <!-- h3 -->
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="questionsetmanagement">Question Set Management</h2>

<div class=h3>
<h3 id="managequestionset">Manage Question Set</h3>

<p>Clicking the &quot;Manage Question Set&quot; link will allow you to search through the
Question Set, modify questions, add questions, remove question, transfer ownership, or
add a set of questions to a question library.  Only administrators or question owners
have the rights to remove a question.  Be aware that if you remove
a question that is currently being used in an assessment (as shown in the &quot;Times
Used&quot; column), it will mess up that assessment.
</p>
<p>
The options available in the question set manager are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modify</strong>: Change the source code of the question and make library assignments.  You will only see this option for
   questions you own or when the owner has given permission for anyone to modify the question.</li>
<li><strong>View</strong>:  View the source code of the question and make library assignements.  You will only see this option for question
   you do not own.</li>
<li><strong>Template</strong>:  Create a new question, using the code of an existing question as a starting point.  When you template a
   question, the original question is not changed.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>:  Delete the question completely from the questionset and all libraries.  You will only see this option for
   questions you own or when the owner has given permission for anyone to modify the question.  You can delete many questions at once
   by selecting questions with the checkboxes, then clicking the Delete button near the top of the page.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong>:  Transfer ownership of the question to another user.  You will only see this option for
   questions you own.  You can transfer many questions at once
   by selecting questions with the checkboxes, then clicking the Transfer button near the top of the page.</li>
<li><strong>Library Assignment</strong>:  The Library Assignment button near the top of the page can be used with the checkboxes to add or change your
   library assignments for the selected questions.  This will not affect other people's assignments</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the assignment of questions into libraries can be done by anyone, but only the person who made the assignment is able
to remove the question from the assigned library</p>


</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="exportquestionset">Export Question Set</h3>

Use the &quot;Export Question Set&quot; feature to export a portion of the Question Set
for backup or sharing.  Use the search feature with the checkboxes to select
questions for inclusion in the export.  Clicking the &quot;Finalize&quot; button, you
will be asked for a Library Description.


</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="importquestionset">Import Question Set</h3>
<p>
Use the &quot;Import Question Set&quot; feature to import a Question Set that you or
someone else had exported from IMathAS.  Be sure to only import question sets from
trusted sources.  After specifying an import file, you will be given a chance
to select specific questions from the set to be imported.
</p>
<p>
Imported questions will have ownership assigned to the importer.  Select the
userights you want to apply to all imported questions.  You also can import
the questions directly into an existing or new question library</p>

<p>If any questions (identified by a unique id) already exist in your system, you
will be asked if you want to update the existing questions, or add as new questions.
If you have modified questions previously imported, you may want to add as new. </p>

</div> <!-- h3 -->
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="librarymanagement">Library Management</h2>
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="managelibraries">Manage Libraries</h3>
<p>
Use the library manager to remove, rename, change rights, change parent, or transfer
ownership of question libraries.  Be aware that if a library is deleted, the
questions in that library will become unassigned; they are not deleted.
</p><p>
Libraries have a tree structure, where each library has a parent library.  When you
add or modify a library, you can change it's parent library.  If you change a library's
parent, all children library move with a library.  You can only specify an empty
library or existing parent library as a parent.
</p>
<p>
Libraries have use rights.  Options are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private</strong>:  Only the owner or an administrator can list questions in these libraries</li>
<li><strong>Closed to group, private to others</strong>: Anyone in group can list and use questions, , but only
	the owner or an admin can add questions to the library.  Hidden to anyone outside the group.</li>
<li><strong>Open to group, private to others</strong>: Anyone in group can list and use questions and add to the library.
	Hidden to anyone outside the group.</li>
<li><strong>Closed to all</strong>:  Everyone can list and use questions, but only the owner or an admin can add questions to the library</li>
<li><strong>Open to group, close to others</strong>: Anyone in group can list and use questions and add to the library.
       Outside the group, users can only list and use questions; they cannot add questions to the library</li>
<li><strong>Open to all</strong>:  Everyone can list and use questions and add to the library</li>
</ul>
<p>
With library rights, child rights take precedence over parent rights.  For example,
if an open library is a child to a private library, the parent will not be hidden
from other users.  However a private library as child to a private parent will be
hidden from other users.
</p>
<p>Depending upon the system configuration, non-admins may be limited to creating libraries that are private
to others outside their group.  If this is the case, a non-admin will need to contact an admin to create a library
that is closed or open to all.</p>
<p>
Library assignments are done in question management.  Library assignments can be done
by any user, but only the person who made the assignment can remove that assignment.
</p>
</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="exportlibraries">Export Libraries</h3>
Use the &quot;Export Libraries&quot; feature to export an entire library or tree
of libraries for backup or sharing.  Use the tree to select libraries to export.
Note that if a parent library is selected, it's children libraries are automatically
included in the export, and heirarchy will be maintained. If libraries from different
trees are selected, the topmost libraries in each branch selected will be exported
at the same level.
</div> <!-- h3 -->

<div class=h3>
<h3 id="importlibraries">Import Libraries</h3>
<p>Use the &quot;Import Libraries&quot; feature to import an entire library or tree
of libraries.  After selecting a file, the tree of libraries in the import file
will be shown, and you can deselect libraries you do not want to import.  Note that
if a parent library is not selected, NONE of the children libraries will be added,
regardless of whether they're checked or not.</p>

<p>You will be asked if you want to update existing questions/libraries, or add as new.  If
a library or question (identified by a unique id) in the import already exists on your system,
this will tell the importer whether to update the existing libraries/questions, or import
the libraries/questions as a new copy (a new unique id is assigned).
If you have modified questions previously imported, you may want to add as new. </p>

<p>
Imported libraries and questions will have ownership assigned to the importer.  Select the
userights you want to apply to all imported questions and libraries.  You can select
a parent in the library tree for all (top level) imported libraries</p>

<p>
If you load a file that does not have a library tree embedded in the file, you will
be told to use the Import Question Set feature instead.  Even if a file has a library
tree, you can use the Import Question Set feature to import specific questions from
the file.
</p>
</div> <!-- h3 -->

</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="installmacrofile">Install Macro File</h2>
<p>A Macro Library contains macros (functions) which can be used in questions.  These
expand the capabilities of IMathAS.  If allowed, installation requires selecting the file name
from your local computer and clicking "Submit".  Be aware that any existing
macro library of the same name will be replaced.  A help file is automatically
generated for newly installed macro libraries.</p>
<p>
<strong>Warning!</strong>: Macro libraries are pure PHP (programming code), and have a large
security risk.  <strong>Only install macro libraries from a trusted source</strong>
</p>

</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="deleteoldusers">Delete Old Users</h2>

Use the Delete Old Users option to delete users who have not accessed the system within
some specified number of months.  You can delete just students, or all non-Admin users.

</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="importstudents">Import Students from File</h2>

Use the Import Students from File feature to register and enroll a set of students
automatically from a CSV (commas separated values) file.  You can generate a CSV
file using any spreadsheet program.

<p>
The form will guide you through specifying which columns of the CSV file contain
First name, Last name, email address, and desired username.  Once setting these options,
the first five rows of the file will be displayed so you can verify that the import
settings are correct.  If you selected a class to enroll the imported students in,
the students will be both registered and enrolled in that class upon submission.</p>

</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="managegroups">Manage Groups</h2>
<p>Groups allow instructors to be divided into groups (by school, for example).  Groups
can create group-specific libraries, and Group Admins can be assigned to have Admin
rights over group users and libraries.  By default, users are added to a Default group.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Edit Groups</strong> to add, modify, or delete groups.</p>

</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="diagnostics">Diagnostics</h2>
<p>Diagnostics allow you to create a special login page for larger-scale diagnostic assessment.
This provides a way for students to access and take the diagnostic without needing
to register and enroll in a course.  Also, it delivers them the correct assessment based
on a specified selection.</p>

<p>If you are a group admin or full admin, click the "Add New Diagnostic" button to set up
a new diagnostic.  Diagnostics are linked with assessments in a course, so you should first
create a course and add your diagnostic assessments to that course.</p>

<p>Over two pages, you will be asked for:
<ul>
 <li>Diagnostic name: the name of your diagnostic to display to students on the login page</li>
 <li>Term designator: Can be changed each term for ongoing assessments to keep track of which term an assessment was taken in.  Also will create a unique
   username for each term, so same student ID could take the assessment again in the different term.</li>
 <li>Linked with course:  What course contains your diagnostic assessments.  You must be listed as a teacher for the course</li>
 <li>Available:  Whether students can take the diagnostic</li>
 <li>Public:  Whether the diagnostic should be listed on the main Diagnostics list page at $imasroot/diag.  If set to no,
     students will have to be provided with the direct link to the diagnostic.</li>
 <li>Allow Reentry:  Whether students should be forced to complete the diagnostic in one sitting, or whether you'll allow them
     to reaccess the test at a later time.  If Yes, you can set a testing window that limits the number of minutes after first accessing
     the diagnostic they can reenter the diagnostic.</li>
 <li>Unique ID prompt:  How you want to word the prompt for a unique user id</li>
 <li>ID entry format:  Lets you specify the format of the unique ID, so ensure valid IDs</li>
 <li>Allow access IP addresses:  IP addressed for which the diagnostic can be taken without a password.  If you want to
     allow access from anywhere, enter "*".  You can use "*" for a wildcard as well, e.g. 123.45.* to allow any IP beginning
     with 123.45.</li>
 <li>Passwords:  Passwords which will allow access to the diagnostic from other IP addresses.  Passwords are not case sensitive.</li>
 <li>Super passwords:  These passwords will override the "allow reentry" time limit, if you specified one earlier.  These passwords would be intended
     for use by instructors or proctors, and generally would not be shared directly with students.</li>
  <li>First level selector name:  Students will be asked to select two items from pull-down lists, with the values in the second
     depending upon the values in the first.  The choice in the first list also dictates which assessment is delivered.  For
     selector name, specify what this selection should be called, filling in the blank "Please enter your ______".  In many cases
     the two selectors will be Course and Instructor, or Course and Section</li>
 <li>First level selector options:  Add options for the first level selector</li>
 <li>Second level selector name:  Secondary selection, with values depending upon the first-level selector choice.  Fill in the blank
	"Enter your _________".  Second level selectors will be become the student's section identifier in the course, allowing you to
	use the tutor system with diagnostics.</li>
 <li>Deliver assessment:  For each first-level selector, specify which assessment should be delivered if the student
     selects that option</li>
 <li>Second level selector options:  For each first-level selector, specify the options for the second level selector.</li>
</ul>
<p>After submitting the second page, you will be provided with the direct access link to the diagnostic, which you can
provide to students or use to create a link from another website</p>

<p>In courses for which a diagnostic has been set up, the gradebook will display differently, showing the student unique ID,
the term, and the first and second selector values in addition to the students' names and scores</p>

</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="managingadministrators">Managing Administrators and Teachers</h2>

At the bottom of the admin page is a list of users.  Group Admins will see the teachers in their group.  For Full Admins,
teacher and higher level users are grouped by instructor Group, or are in the Default
group if you haven't defined groups.  Student accounts can be listed by choosing the corresponding first letter of the last name.  To approve

<div class=h3>
<h3 id="assessments">Assessments</h3>

<strong>Warning:</strong> Making changes to an assessment after students have already taken it
can seriously mess up those students' assessment results.  It is NOT safe to change:  Default points per problem or Default penalty.


<div class=h4>
<h4 id="assessmentsettings">Assessment Settings</h4>

You need to set the assessment settings when you add an assessment.  You can
change these settings by clicking the &quot;Modify Settings&quot; link next to the
assessment in the course page.
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>:  The name of the assessment</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>:  A description of the summary (shows on course page)</li>
<li><strong>Intro/Instructions</strong>:  Displays at the top of the test (see below for details on making question-specific instructions)</li>
<li><strong>Available after</strong>:  The first date for the item to be available to students</li>
<li><strong>Available until</strong>:  The last date for the item to be available to students.  Students must complete the assessment by this date - they will
    be kicked out if they are in the middle of an assessment when this time is reached.</li>
<li><strong>Available for review</strong>:  If the checkbox is clicked, the assessment will convert to review mode after the due date
    until this date.  Review mode defaults to Skip Around display, unlimited attempts, answers shown always.  Scores are not
    saved in Review mode.</li>
<li><strong>Count</strong>:  Whether the assessment score should be counted in the gradebook, not counted in the grade total, or counted as extra credit.</li>
<li><strong>Copy Options From</strong>:  If you have other assessments in your course already, you can select to copy the assessment settings
   from another assessment.</li>
<li><strong>Password</strong>:  If specified, requires student to enter this password to access the assessment.  Leave blank to require no password.</li>
<li><strong>Time Limit</strong>:  The time limit, in minutes, for the test (0 for none).  If the student exceeds the
   time limit, their test will be recorded, and you can decide whether or not
   to accept it in the gradebook detail.  Partial minutes are possible using decimal values.  If you check the
   "Kick student out at timelimit" box, then the assessment will automatically finalize at the timelimit, and submission
   attempts after the timelimit will be rejected.</li>
<li><strong>Display method</strong>:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Full test at once</strong>:  All questions are displayed on one page</li>
	<li><strong>One question at a time</strong>:  One question is shown at a time.  Students
	    must complete the questions in the order presented</li>
	<li><strong>Full test, submit one at time</strong>: Full test is displayed, but student submits
	    answer to one question at a time.  Student can skip between questions.</li>
	<li><strong>Skip around</strong>:  Students are provided with a navigation bar and can
	    jump between questions and complete them in any order</li>
	<li><strong>Embedded</strong>:  Similar to "Full test, submit one at time", but all questions are
	    always active, and any one can be submitted at any time.  Questions can be embedded into the
	    Intro/Instructions using [QUESTION #] tags.</li>
	</ul></li>
<li><strong>Default points per problem</strong>:  How many points each problem should be worth by default.
    This can be changed for individual problems.</li>
<li><strong>Default attempts per problem</strong>:  How many attempts a student should have at each problem by default.
    This can be changed for individual problems.  Enter 0 for unlimited attempts</li>
<li><strong>Reattempts different versions</strong>:  Reattempting a problem will regenerate the question with new numbers.  By default,
    reattempts of problems receive the same version of the problem.  This option does not make sense to use with Homework mode.</li>
<li><strong>Default penalty per missed attempt</strong>:  What percentage of points possible a student should lose
    for an incorrect attempt.  This can be changed for individual problems.  You can select a penalty for
    each missed attempt, to start after a certain number of missed attempts, or specify a penalty for the last possible attempt only.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback method</strong>:  What detail the students should see
	<ul>
	<li><strong>No scores shown</strong>:  No scores, including the total, are shown to the student.  If reattempts are allowed,
	    the student is forced to retake all questions (even ones they got right the first time).  With this
	    mode, access to grade detail in the gradebook controlled by the Show Answers setting.</li>
	<li><strong>Final score</strong>:  Only final (total) score is shown at the end.  If reattempts are allowed,
	    the student is forced to retake all questions (even ones they got right the first time).  With this
	    mode, access to grade detail in the gradebook controlled by the Show Answers setting.</li>
	<li><strong>Show score on each at end</strong>:  At the end of the test, the student is shown their score on
	    each question.  If reattempts are allowed, they are then allowed to go back and reattempt
	    problems.</li>
	<li><strong>Show as submitted</strong>:  As each question is submitted, the score is shown, and students are
	    offered a chance to reattempt the problem (if allowed).  This method does not apply to the
	    &quot;Full test at once&quot; display method.</li>
	<li><strong>Practice Test</strong>:  Same as above, and the test can be regenerated (re-randomized) whenever the student wants.
	    Students are given an opportunity to try similar problems to
	    the one presented after completing each question (when not in Full test at once mode).  Scores are cleared each time
	    the test is regenerated, and scores are not shown by default in the gradebook.  Answers can be shown after some number
	    of attempts.</li>
	<li><strong>Homework</strong>:  Like "Show as submitted", but students are given an opportunity to attempt a similar
	    question if they miss a question.  Doing so resets attempts for that question (reseting attempt penalty as well).
	    Also, show answers (see below) can be set to show answers during the homework after a number of attempts.  This is
	    best used in conjunction with the attempt penalty.</li>
	</ul></li>
<li><strong>Show Answers</strong>:  When (if ever) students should be able to see answers.
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Practice Tests and Homework</strong>:  For practice tests and homework, you can set this to never, after 0,1,3,4,or 5 attempts are made,
	    or after last attempt.  There is also an after last attempt option that will allow students to jump directly to the answer.</li>
	<li><strong>Other Tests</strong>:  For other tests, you can set this to never, after the assessment due date, after the last last attempt (in Skip Around and Full
	    test submitted one at time modes only), or immediately.
	    Answers will be available in the gradebook review of a test.  <em>Note</em>:  Do not use the "Immediately" option if you
	    are allowing multiple attempts per problem.  Doing so would allow a student to complete the test, view the answers, then
	    reenter the test (since more attempts are allowed) and put in the correct answers.  Also be aware that if an assessment
	    is set to allow review mode, that answers will be available to students in review mode.</li>
	</ul></li>
<li><strong>Show hints when available</strong>:  Whether or not to show hints if the question has them defined</li>
<li><strong>Allow use of LatePasses</strong>:  If you have granted LatePasses to students, this will allow use of them on this assessment</li>
<li><strong>Make hard to print</strong>:  Makes the assessment harder to print, for in-class tests</li>
<li><strong>Shuffle item order</strong>:  Randomizes the order in which questions are presented</li>
<li><strong>Gradebook Category</strong>:  If you have created gradebook categories, you can assign the assessment to one of those categories.</li>
<li><strong>Count</strong>:  Whether to count the assessment in the gradebook</li>
<li><strong>Allow tutors to edit</strong>:  Whether tutors should be able to change students' scores on this assessment</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Score for Credit</strong>:  A minimum score which must be acheived to receive credit for the assessment.  Set to 0 to accept all scores.
   If set and score is not met, gradebook will display "NC" (No Credit).</li>
<li><strong>Show based on another assessment</strong>:  Use this to hide this assessment until a specific score is acheived on another
  assessment.  Provide a point value and select an assessment to use this feature.  Set the assessment to "Don't Use" to not use
  this feature</li>
<li><strong>All questions same random seed</strong>: Usually not needed.  This is only need for a set of questions designed to work together using the same random values</li>
<li><strong>All students receive same version of questions</strong>:  All students receive the same first version of questions.  If in practice test or homework mode, when
students request a similar problem, different students will receive different versions of the questions.</li>
<li><strong>Penalty for questions done while in exception/LatePass</strong>:  A percent penalty to take on all questions submitted after the original assignment due date while under a due date exception.</li>
<li><strong>Is group assessment?</strong>: Allows students to specify group members for the assignment.  All group members will receive the same score for the assignment</li>
<li><strong>Show question categories?</strong>:  If you plan to categorize questions and would like the categories displayed while the student is taking the test, you can
 select that option here</li>
<li><strong>LTI access secret</strong>:  An access code to place this assessment in a BasicLTI-compliant consumer.  <a href="#lti">More info</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Qustion-specific instructions</strong> (deprecated)</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: The following approach is deprecated, and no longer recommended.  Using the [+Text] button on the Add/Remove Questions
 page instead to insert text between questions.</p>
<p>In the Intro/Instructions box, you can make question-specific instructions by putting a tag of the form [Q #] or [Q #-#] before the
text specific to that question or range of questions.  Here is an example:</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid #000;padding:8px;">
<p>This is the general info<p>
<p>[Q 1]</p>
<p>This text will display before question 1</p>
<p>[Q 3-4]</p>
<p>This text will display before questions 3 and 4.  Since there was no tag for question 2, it will display
  directly after question 1, with no associated intro text.  Likewise, if there was a question 5, it would
  display directly after question 4 with no associated intro text.</p>

<div class=h4>
<h4 id="addingquestionstoanassessment">Adding Questions to an Assessment</h4>

<p>You can add existing questions to an assessment by clicking the &quot;Select Library&quot; button
to choose libraries to search, then the &quot;Search&quot; button to
list potential questions.  Leave the &quot;Search&quot; entry blank to list all questions in the libraries selected.  The checkboxes
can be used to search in all libraries (not just the selected ones), list only questions you own, or exclude questions you've already
added to your assessment.</p>
From this list you can:
<ul>
<li>Use the checkboxes to select questions, then click the &quot;Add Selected (using defaults)&quot;
button to add the questions.  Adding this way will use the assessment default settings for
points, attempts allowed, and penalty per attempt.  You can change these later by
clicking the &quot;Change Settings&quot; link.</li>
<li>Use the checkboxes to select questions, then click the &quot;Add&quot;
button to add the questions.  Adding this way will allow you to override the default settings for
points, attempts allowed, and penalty per attempt if you wish, and add a question multiple times.</li>
<li>Click the &quot;Add&quot; link.  This will allow you to change the default
question settings</li>
<li>Click &quot;Use as template for New Question&quot; link.  This will create a new question based
upon the existing question.  This allows you to avoid rewriting a question from
scratch if a similar question exists</li>
<li>Click &quot;Preview&quot; to preview the question</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, you can click the "Select from Assessments" button to choose questions from existing assessments.
In this mode, select the assessments you wish to pull questions from and click "Use these assessments".  Then select
the questions you wish to use.</p>

Once added to the assessment you can:
<ul>
<li><strong>Reorder Questions</strong>: When "Rearrange Questions" is selected, using the number selectors next
    to each question will allow you to rearrange the order of the questions.  This is only useful if you
    are not shuffling the question order</li>
<li><strong>Group Questions</strong>:  When "Group Questions" is selected, using the number selectors next to each
    question will allow you to group questions.  When questions are grouped, the testing engine will randomly
    select one question from the group to display to the student</li>
<li><strong>Change Settings</strong>:  Override the default settings for points, attempts allowed, and
    penalty per attempt, if desired</li>
<li><strong>Edit Source</strong>:  Change the question code or wording</li>
<li><strong>Remove from assessment</strong>:  Remove the question from the assessment.  This does not
    delete the question from the Question Set.  You can also use the checkboxes and the "With selected, Remove"
    button to remove multiple questions at once.</li>
</ul>

<div class=h5>
<h5 id="questionintrotext">Adding an Introduction to a Question</h5>
<p>In addition to the assignment Introduction, each question can have an individual introduction.  A common example is to display a video and then a related question as part of a video assignment.</p>
<p>To add a question introduction, click on <span style="font-weight: bold">+ Text</span> below the last question.  An editable text box will appear where you can write instuctions or drag in a video link.  After you edit your text, click the <span class="mce-i-save" style="font-family: tinymce; font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Save All</span> icon in the editor toolbar.  You can expand/collapse each question intro by clicking the <span class="icon-pencil" style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Expand and Edit</span> or <span class="icon-shrink2" style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Collapse</span> icons in the lower right of the question intro.  Once you modify a question intro, you'll need to save it to collapse it.</p>
<p>When you click <span class="mce-i-save" style="font-family: tinymce; font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Save All</span>, all changes you have made in any other question intros will also be saved.  If you leave a question intro with unsaved changes, the Save All button will be highlighted.</p>
<p>A question intro can be displayed for multiple consecutive questions (except on Embedded assignments).  In the <span style="font-weight: bold">Show for</span> selector, select the number of questions that question intro should be used for.</p>
<p>Embedded assignments can include page titles.  Check the <span style="font-weight: bold">New Page</span> checkbox to add a page title. Then add your title in the editor and save it.</p>
<p>Below the last questions is an <span class="icon-enlarge2" style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Expand All</span> button which will expand all the question intros.  Click on any one to edit it.<p>
</div> <!-- h5 -->

<p>If students have taken the assessment, you will not be allowed to make as many changes to the assessment, as it
will mess up existing student attempts.  If you need to change the assessment a lot, you can clear all student attempts.
Otherwise you can change individual question settings (be careful!) or edit the question if it's yours.  If there is a problem with
the question, you modify it, and want to give students another chance on that question, you can clear all attempts on a single question
by clicking the "Clear Attempts" link here</p>

<h2 id="questionsetmanagementcm">Question Set Management</h2>

<div class=h3>
<h3 id="managequestionsetcm">Manage Question Set</h3>

<p>Clicking the &quot;Manage Question Set&quot; link will allow you to search through the
Question Set, modify questions, add questions, remove question, transfer ownership, or
add a set of questions to a question library.  Only administrators or question owners
have the rights to remove a question.  Be aware that if you remove
a question that is currently being used in an assessment (as shown in the &quot;Times
Used&quot; column), it will mess up that assessment.
</p>
<p>
The options available in the question set manager are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modify</strong>: Change the source code of the question and make library assignments.  You will only see this option for
   questions you own or when the owner has given permission for anyone to modify the question.</li>
<li><strong>View</strong>:  View the source code of the question and make library assignements.  You will only see this option for question
   you do not own.</li>
<li><strong>Template</strong>:  Create a new question, using the code of an existing question as a starting point.  When you template a
   question, the original question is not changed.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>:  Delete the question completely from the questionset and all libraries.  You will only see this option for
   questions you own or when the owner has given permission for anyone to modify the question.  You can delete many questions at once
   by selecting questions with the checkboxes, then clicking the Delete button near the top of the page.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong>:  Transfer ownership of the question to another user.  You will only see this option for
   questions you own.  You can transfer many questions at once
   by selecting questions with the checkboxes, then clicking the Transfer button near the top of the page.</li>
<li><strong>Library Assignment</strong>:  The Library Assignment button near the top of the page can be used with the checkboxes to add or change your
   library assignments for the selected questions.  This will not affect other people's assignments</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the assignment of questions into libraries can be done by anyone, but only the person who made the assignment is able
to remove the question from the assigned library</p>

</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="exportquestionsetcm">Export Question Set</h3>

Use the &quot;Export Question Set&quot; feature to export a portion of the Question Set
for backup or sharing.  Use the search feature with the checkboxes to select
questions for inclusion in the export.  Clicking the &quot;Finalize&quot; button, you
will be asked for a Library Description.


</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="importquestionsetcm">Import Question Set</h3>
<p>
Use the &quot;Import Question Set&quot; feature to import a Question Set that you or
someone else had exported from IMathAS.  Be sure to only import question sets from
trusted sources.  After specifying an import file, you will be given a chance
to select specific questions from the set to be imported.
</p>
<p>
Imported questions will have ownership assigned to the importer.  Select the
userights you want to apply to all imported questions.  You can import
the questions directly into an existing library, or into the Unassigned library
for later assignment.</p>

<p>If any questions (identified by a unique id) already exist in your system, you
will be asked if you want to update the existing questions, or add as new questions.
If you have modified questions previously imported, you may want to add as new. </p>

</div> <!-- h3 -->
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="librarymanagementcm">Library Management</h2>
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="managelibrariescm">Manage Libraries</h3>
<p>
Use the library manager to remove, rename, change rights, change parent, or transfer
ownership of question libraries.  Be aware that if a library is deleted, the
questions in that library will become unassigned; they are not deleted.
</p><p>
Libraries have a tree structure, where each library has a parent library.  When you
add or modify a library, you can change it's parent library.  If you change a library's
parent, all children library move with a library.  You can only specify an empty
library or existing parent library as a parent.
<p>
Libraries have use rights.  Options are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private</strong>:  Only the owner or an administrator can list questions in these libraries</li>
<li><strong>Closed to group, private to others</strong>: Anyone in group can list and use questions, , but only
	the owner or an admin can add questions to the library.  Hidden to anyone outside the group.</li>
<li><strong>Open to group, private to others</strong>: Anyone in group can list and use questions and add to the library.
	Hidden to anyone outside the group.</li>
<li><strong>Closed to all</strong>:  Everyone can list and use questions, but only the owner or an admin can add questions to the library</li>
<li><strong>Open to group, close to others</strong>: Anyone in group can list and use questions and add to the library.
       Outside the group, users can only list and use questions; they cannot add questions to the library</li>
<li><strong>Open to all</strong>:  Everyone can list and use questions and add to the library</li>
</ul>
<p>
With library rights, child rights take precedence over parent rights.  For example,
if an open library is a child to a private library, the parent will not be hidden
from other users.  However a private library as child to a private parent will be
hidden from other users.
</p>
<p>Depending upon the system configuration, non-admins may be limited to creating libraries that are private
to others outside their group.  If this is the case, a non-admin will need to contact an admin to create a library
that is closed or open to all.</p>
<p>
Library assignments are done in question management.  Library assignments can be done
by any user, but only the person who made the assignment can remove that assignment.
</p>
</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="exportlibrariescm">Export Libraries</h3>
Use the &quot;Export Libraries&quot; feature to export an entire library or tree
of libraries for backup or sharing.  Use the tree to select libraries to export.
Note that if a parent library is selected, it's children libraries are automatically
included in the export, and heirarchy will be maintained. If libraries from different
trees are selected, the topmost libraries in each branch selected will be exported
at the same level.
</div> <!-- h3 -->

<div class=h3>
<h3 id="importlibrariescm">Import Libraries</h3>
<p>Use the &quot;Import Libraries&quot; feature to import an entire library or tree
of libraries.  After selecting a file, the tree of libraries in the import file
will be shown, and you can deselect libraries you do not want to import.  Note that
if a parent library is not selected, NONE of the children libraries will be added,
regardless of whether they're checked or not.</p>

<p>You will be asked if you want to update existing questions/libraries, or add as new.  If
a library or question (identified by a unique id) in the import already exists on your system,
this will tell the importer whether to update the existing libraries/questions, or import
the libraries/questions as a new copy (a new unique id is assigned).
If you have modified questions previously imported, you may want to add as new.
Note that only the original importer can update questions they imported.</p>

<p>
Imported libraries and questions will have ownership assigned to the importer.  Select the
userights you want to apply to all imported questions and libraries.  You can select
a parent in the library tree for all (top level) imported libraries</p>

<p>
If you load a file that does not have a library tree embedded in the file, you will
be told to use the Import Question Set feature instead.  Even if a file has a library
tree, you can use the Import Question Set feature to import specific questions from
the file.

<h2 id="liststudents">List Students</h2>
<p>
Use the &quot;List Students&quot; link to list the students in your class.  On this page you can
import (register and enroll) students from a file, enroll a student (already registered)
with a known username.  This is the easiest way to add a guest user to your class.  Note that the "Last Login"
date shows the last time the student logged into IMathAS, not necessarily the last time they accessed
your course.
</p>
<p>The List Students page also gives you access to student email addresses, as well as a link to send out a mass email or message
to all students</p>

<div class=h3>
<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

Click the &quot;Make Exception&quot; link to change the Start or End date of an assessment
for a single student.  If you need to make exceptions for multiple students at once, or want to make
exceptions for multiple assessments at once, use the "Make Exception" button in connection with the checkboxes
in the Gradebook.

</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="resettingpasswords">Resetting Passwords / Changing Info</h3>

Use the &quot;Chg Info&quot; link to reset a student's password,
update their email address, username or full name, or change their section or code.
You can also lock the student out of the course on this page.  Doing so will
display a message to the student that they need to see their instructor to
regain access to the course.  On this page you can also set a time limit multiplier
for students needing extra time on timed assessments.  Setting the multiplier to 1.5 would
give the student 1.5 times the usual timelimit for all assessments.

</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="unenrolling">Unenrolling</h3>

Use the &quot;Unenroll&quot; link to unenroll a student from the class, or the &quot;Unenroll All&quot; button
to unenroll all students.  This can be useful to clear out a classroom at the end of
a term.  Unenrolling all students will also delete all regular posts from the course's forums.

</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="importstudentscm">Import Students from File</h3>

Use the Import Students from File feature to register and enroll a set of students
automatically from a CSV (commas separated values) file.  You can generate a CSV
file using any spreadsheet program.

<p>
The form will guide you through specifying which columns of the CSV file contain
First name, Last name, email address, and desired username.  Once setting these options,
the first five rows of the file will be displayed so you can verify that the import
settings are correct.  The students will be both registered and enrolled in the
current class upon submission.</p>

</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="sectioncodes">Assigning Section and/or Code Numbers</h3>

<p>Click the "Assign section and/or code numbers" link to assign section or code
numbers to students.  These only serve for identification purposes, the the gradebook

must be numeric, up to 4 digits.</p>

</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="managelatepasses">Manage LatePasses</h3>

<p>Click the "Manage LatePasses" link to give students LatePasses.  Students can redeed
a LatePass for an extension on an online assessment without your intervention, provided
you have clicked the "Allow use of latepasses" option in that assessment.</p>

<p>On this page you can also define the number of hours extension a LatePass will grant</p>

</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="managetutors">Manage Tutors</h3>

<p>Click the "Manage Tutors" link to manage tutors for your class.  Tutors can have an
instructor account or student account. Tutors will be able to view students' scores
and online assessments.  If given permission, tutors can edit or enter online or offline
scores.</p>

<p>Add tutors by listing their usernames in the box
provided.  Remove tutors by clicking the "Remove" checkboxes next to tutors and clicking Update</p>

<p>Once tutors are added, you can limit them to a single section of the course.  If selected,
tutors will only be able to see scores for students in the section they're limited to.  This
can be used in conjunction with the diagnostic system, since second-level selections become the
student's section identifier</p>

</div> <!-- h3 -->

due date exceptions for multiple students at once</p>

<div class=h3>
<h3 id="gradebooksettings">Gradebook Settings and Categories</h3>
<p>Click the "Gradebook Settings" to change Gradebook settings and create or modify categories.  This allows
you to create a grading scheme.</p>
<p>Your overall settings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate total using:  Select "points earned" to use a points earned out of points possible grading scheme.  Select "Category weights" to
assign a percentage weight to each category in calculation of total grade.</li>
<li>Gradebook display:  Select whether to order the gradebook by item dates (Available until dates for assessments,
Show After dates for offline grades) or if you want to group items by category</li>
</ul>

<p>The next section lets you define categories.  There is always the "Default" category, but it will not display if there are no items
assigned to it.  To add a new category, click the "Add Category" link to add a new line to the table, then fill in the name and
other info, then click "Update"</p>
<p>For each category, you can specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name:  The name of the category</li>
<li>Scale (optional):  Scale the category total by specifying a point value or percent value to be scaled up to 100%.
For example, if the category point value was 80 points, and a student earned 50 points, their category total would be 50 points.
If you specified a scale of 60 points, then the students grade would become 80*(50/60) = 66.7 points out of 80.  You can specify whether
grades that would end up over 100% should be chopped to 100%.  You can specify no scale by leaving the Scale box blank.</li>
<li>Drops (optional):  You can specify whether to drop the lowest N scores, or keep the highest N scores from the category.  Set the number to 0 to keep all scores.</li>
<li>Weight/Fix Category Point Total:  If you are using a "Category Weights" grading scheme, enter the percent weights for each category
here.  If the category percents don't add to 100%, they are all scaled equally so they do add to 100%.  If you are using a "Points earned" grading scheme, you can
fix the point value for the category here (optional).  For example, if the current category total is 50 points and a student earns 40 points,
if you specified a fixed point value of 100 points, the students score would become 80 points.  Leave this blank to use the actual
category point total.</li>
<li>Remove:  When you remove a category, any items currently assigned to that category will be assigned to the Default category</li>
</ul>


</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="offlinegrades">Offline Grades</h3>
To add an offline grade, click the "Add Offline Grade" link on the gradebook page.  You can specify:

<li>Show to students after:  The date after which to show the item to students</li>
<li>Gradebook Category:  The gradebook category you wish to assign the item to</li>
<li>Count:  Whether to count the score in the gradebook total, not count it, or count it as extra credit</li>
<li>Allow tutors to edit:  Whether tutors should be able to edit scores for this item</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then enter grades for each student.  If you leave a grade blank, no grade will be recorded for that student.
You can edit these settings or edit all students' grades at a later time by clicking the "Average" in the gradebook for this item.
You can edit an individual student's grade by clicking on their score in the gradebook for this item.  You can leave feedback for

<h3 id="gradebookdetail">Gradebook Detail</h3>

<p>When you click on a student's score in the gradebook, you will see the specific
assessment that they received and the last answer they provided, as well as their
score on each question and the attempts used.  You can override the scores they
received on this page.  You can also send a student a message about a question, quoting
their version of the question in the message.  At the bottom of the page is a box to leave the student
feedback about the assessment.</p>
<p>If you wish to give a student another chance to take an assessment, click
the "Clear Attempt" or "Clear Scores" link.  <strong>Note</strong>: This will clear their current scores,
answers, and attempts used.  The "Clear Attempt" link will make it appear the student never started
the assessment, and the student will receive a different version of the assessment when they access the assessment.
The "Clear Scores" link will clear the student's scores and attempts to 0, but the student will receive the same
version of the assessment when they access it.
</p>
<p>If you categorized the questions in the assessment, you will also see a category
breakdown at the bottom of the details page</p>

</div> <!-- h3 -->
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="stugroups">Student Groups</h2>
<p>The Student Groups page allows you to manipulate student groups associated with assessments that you have designated as group
assessments.  When you first access this page, you will be presented with a list of group assessments.  Select the assessment you
want to modify groups for</p>

<p>You will be presented with a list of groups (the group number is arbitrary) with the students in each group.  To separate a
student from the group, click the "Break from Group" link.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page is a list of students not assigned to a group.  If you wish to assign students to groups, click the
checkboxes next to the students' names.  In the "add to group: " pulldown, select the group you want to add the students to, or select
"New Group", and click Add</p>

<p>When students are broken from the group, they retain the version of the assessment and progress the group had acheived before you
broke them from the group.  If a student is added to a group, any work they've already done is lost and replaced with the group's
version and progress.  Any changes to an assessment made by one group member affects all group members.</p>
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>

<div class=h2>
<h2 id="copycourseitems">Copy Course Items</h2>
<p>Course Item Copy allows you to copy items in your course or an entire course structure, or copy items from
another instructor's course.  Note that item structure, items, and settings are exported, but not students, assessment
attempts, or forum threads.</p>

<p>On the first page, select a course to copy from.  If you select a course that is not one of your own courses,
you must enter the course Enrollment Key as verification that you have received permission to copy from the course.</p>

<p>On the second page, select the items you wish to import.  If you export an item currently contained in a block and
do not export the block, the item will be exported as an item on the main course page.</p>

<p>You can optionally append words to the end of the title of each item, or place the copied items into an existing block.</p>

<p>You can optionally also specify to copy the course settings (the items you'd set under Modify on the Admin page), or copy
   the gradebook scheme and gradebook categories.  Copying the gradebook scheme will overwrite the existing gradebook scheme in your
   course.  Copying the gradebook scheme will also retain any category assignments for the assessments you're copying.</p>

</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="masschgdates">Change Dates</h2>
<p>The Change Dates page allows you to change the dates for all your course items on one page.  On this page you will see a list
of your course items, with inputs for start date, end date, and review date (for assessments).  You can filter the list to only
show one item type using the Filter selection at the top of the page, and you can change the sort order to sort by start date, end
date, or name.</p>

<p>If you change dates on any line and click the "Send down list" button on that line, the date change will be made to all items below
that item in the list.  For example, if you add one day to an item and click "Send down list", one day will be added to all items
lower in the list.  By default the system only allows Monday-Friday dates; you can switch to a 7-day week by unchecking the "Shift
by weekdays only" checkbox</p>
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="masschgassessments">Change Assessments</h2>

<h2 id="importexportitems">Import/Export Course Items (for another IMathAS system)</h2>
<p>Course Item import/export allows you to share a course setup with other instructors, or copy
a class for yourself.  Note that item structure and questions are exported, but not students, assessment
attempts, or forum threads.</p>

<p>On Export, start by selecting the items you wish to export.
If you export an item currently contained in a block and do not export the block, the item
will be exported as an item on the main course page.  There are options on whether or not to
include course and gradebook settings in the export.</p>

<p>On Import, first provide the import file.  If there are assessment questions that do not
already exist on your system, they will be added to the system.  Select the library into which
these questions should be imported.  If a question already exists, you can select whether to update
the existing question with the import question (if it is newer), or create a new copy of the question in
the designated library.  Select the items to import, and click "Import Items".</p>

</div> <!-- h2 -->

<div class=h2>
<h2 id="lti">LTI Integration</h2>

<p>IMathAS can be used as a LTI tool using a course-level configuration or a global college-wide configuration.</p>

<p><b>Key Types</b></p>

<p>For a course-level configuration, your LTI key will take the form LTKkey_###_#.  The first number, ###, is your course ID.
The last number determines how authentication is handled.
If that last digit is 0, then when the student accesses the LTI placement, the first time they will be asked to sign into their
IMathAS account or create one, and that account will be linked with the account at the host LMS.  From then on, when the same
student accesses any LTI placement, they will not need to sign in again.  They will be able to sign in directly to IMathAS as well.</p>

<p>If the last digit of your LTI key is 1, then a student account will automatically be created the first time a student
accesses the LTI placement, and that account will be linked with the host LMS account.  The student will not be provided an IMathAS
username or password, so they will only be able to access IMathAS resources through the LMS LTI placements.</p>

<p>Note that grade return ONLY works reliably with the _1 type keys, so that type of key is recommended.</p>

<p><b>LTI Connection Options</b></p>

<p>IMathAS supports several types of LTI integration, including whole course single-signon,
   and new links created from the LMS.</p>

<p>The recommended integration technique is to setup individual LTI links for each
   assessment.  This is necessary if you want the grade to be returned from IMathAS
   to your LMS.  The easiest way to set up LTI links in the LMS is to use the
   Export feature in IMathAS to create links and import those into your LMS. To do this,
   go to Course Items -> Export, select the items you want to export,
   your LMS, and Download the CC Export.  Then follow the appropriate instructions below.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can manually create individual links to assignments, or you
   can create a single link that launches your entire IMathAS course.  Be aware
   that in many LMSs, manually created links to assignments will lose their association
   with IMathAS assessments when the course is copied in the LMS, so using the Import
   process is recommened when supported by the LMS.</p>

<p>IMathAS can also be an LTI consumer, using the External Tool option for Link items.</p>



<div class=h3>
<h3 id="lticanvas">Canvas Integration - Using Import</h3>
	<p>Go to Course Items &rarr; Export, select the items you want to export, select your LMS,
	   and Download the Export Cartridge</p>
	<p>To import the cartridge in Canvas:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Go to Settings, then Import Course Content</li>
		<li>For Content Type, select Canvas Course Export Package.
			Select the export file from your computer,
			and select All Content.  Click Import.</li>
		<li>If you have a course-level configuration, skip ahead.
		   If are setting up a course-level App Config follow these steps.
			<ul>
			<li>Go to Settings, then Apps, then View App Configurations</li>
			<li>Locate for the IMathAS App. Use the gear icon dropdown to select Edit</li>
			<li>For the Consumer Key, enter: <code>LTIkey_####_1</code>, where #### is your Course ID</li>
			<li>For Shared Secret enter the secret you set up in your Course Settings</li>
			<li>Click Submit</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Next you will need to establish the connection between your IMathAS course and Canvas course</p>
	<ul>
	<li>In Canvas, click one of the assessment links in your course.</li>
	<li>If this is your first time using this key and secret, IMathAS will
	    ask you, the teacher, to sign into your IMathAS account.  This is necessary to
	    establish a connection between your LMS account and your IMathAS account.
	    You will not need to do this step again, and students will not be asked to sign in
	    and will not need a IMathAS account.</li>
	<li>Follow the prompts to associate the LMS course with your existing IMathAS course
	    or create a copy.</li>
	<li>Once complete, all the LTI links in your LMS should work.</li>
	<li>Be aware:
		<ul>
		<li>Links, files, forums, and and text items were imported into your LMS.  Changing
		    them in IMathAS will not change them in your LMS</li>
		<li>If you change assessment settings or the questions in an assessment in IMathAS,
		    those changes will show up when the assessment is launched from the LMS</li>
		<li>If you change due dates in IMathAS, they will be enforced by IMathAS, but the due dates
		    in the LMS will not automatically be updated.  However, there is a course setting to allow
		    Canvas to set the due dates in IMathAS.</li>
		<li>Any new items added in IMathAS, including new assessments, will not
		    automatically show up in the LMS; you would need to repeat the export/import process.</li>
		<li>If configured, grades will be sent from IMathAS to the LMS immediately
		    every time the student completes a question, but the LMS may delay updating the grade.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note:  When configuring a course-level configuration, the use of a key in the form <code>LTIkey_###_1</code> is recommended.
	   With this type of key, students will not have or need a username for IMathAS, and they must
	   access assignments via the LMS.  This is usually desired when doing integration, and is necessary to ensure
	   grades are passed from IMathAS back to the LMS.
	   If, however, you are not interested in grade return, and simply want to provide single-signon from your LMS
	   into IMathAS while allowing direct login to IMathAS as well, then you can
	   use a key of the form <code>LTIkey_###_0</code> instead.  This will require students to have or create an
	   account on IMathAS, which they'll have to log into once to establish the connection.</p>

<div class=h2>
<h2 id="basiccontrolsyntax">Basic Control Syntax</h2>
<p>
Lines of the common control, question control, and answer sections usually take the form of variable
definition.  In IMathAS, variables are identified with a dollarsign ($) prefix.  For example,
$a is the variable a.  Most lines will take one of these forms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>$var = number.  Example:  $a = 3</li>
<li>$var = calculation.  Example:  $a = 3*$b*$c</li>
<li>$var = function.  Example:  $a = showplot(&quot;sin(x)&quot;)</li>
<li>$var = randomizer.  Example:  $a = rand(-5,5)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Variable Types</strong></p>
<p>
There are a few types of variables:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A number:  $a = 15.  A calculation like $a = 3^2 will also result in a number</li>
 <li>An array:  $a = array(6,8,10).  This is a collection of variables. You can reference the parts using an index (note that arrays are zero-indexed), so $a[0] = 6.</li>
 <li>A string:  $a = "hi there".</li>
 <li>Boolean:  $a = true</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that numbers are not in quotes, and strings are in quotes.  When you use
the double-quote mark (&quot;) to define a string, you can interpolate variables into
the string.  Example:
</p>
<pre>
$a = 3
$b = 5
$str = &quot;What is $a/$b&quot;
</pre>
<p>
In this example, $str now contains &quot;What is 3/5&quot;.
</p>
<p>Note that strings in single quotes will not interpolate variables</p>

<p><strong>Array assignment</strong></p>
<p>
In some cases you want to define several variables at once.  There are two ways to
do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>$var1,$var2 = arrayfunction.  Example: $a,$b = diffrands(-5,5,2)</li>
<li>$ar = arrayfunction.  Example: $ar = diffrands(-5,5,2)</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the first example, variables $a and $b each take on a single value.  In the second example,
the variable $ar is an array; the elements can be accessed as $ar[0] and $ar[1] (note
that arrays are zero-indexed).  If you use this approach, enclose the variable reference in
parenthesis in calculations, like $new = ($ar[0])^2, and in curly brackets inside strings,
like $string = "there were {$ar[0]} people".
</p><p>
You can also literally define an array using the &quot;array&quot; function.
Examples:  $ar = array(2,3,4,5), or $ar = array(&quot;red&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;)
</p>

<p><strong>Working with Strings</strong></p>
<p>If needed, you can concatenate (combine) two strings using the . operator.  Example:</p>
<pre>
$a = &quot;string one &quot;
$b = &quot;string two&quot;
$both = $a . $b
</pre>
<p>
Here, $both now contains the string &quot;string one string two&quot;
</p>
<p>
If you have a long command to type, you can put a &quot;&amp;&quot; at the end of a line to specify it continues on the next line.  Example:
</p>
<pre>
$questions = array("this is choice 1",&amp;
"this is choice 2")
</pre>
<p>
If defining a string for display, you can put a &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; at the end of a line to specify it continues on the next line and insert
an HTML line break.  Example:
</p>
<pre>
$showanswer = "Do this first. &amp;&amp;
Then do this."
</pre>
<p>will be interpreted as:</p>
<pre>
$showanswer = "Do this first. &lt;br/&gt;Then do this."
</pre>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>You can insert comments in your code by starting the comment with two forward slashes: //this is a comment.
Typically it's best to put comments on their own line, but they can also be placed after a line of code.</p>

<h3 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h3>

<p>
Any assignment line can be followed by one of two conditional:  &quot;where&quot; or &quot;if&quot;.
</p>
<p>
&quot;where&quot; is used to repeat the previous assignment if the condition provided is not met.  The
&quot;where&quot; condition is almost exclusively used with array randomizers.  Example: to select two
different numbers that are not opposites:
</p>
<pre>$a,$b = diffrands(-5,5,2) where ($a+$b!=0)</pre>
<p>
&quot;if&quot; is used to make an assignment conditional.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
$a = rand(0,1)
$b = &quot;sin(x)&quot; if ($a==0)
$b = &quot;cos(x)&quot; if ($a==1)
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of double equal signs (==) for testing equality.  A single equal sign (=) will
make an assignment (change the value of $a in this example) and return &quot;true&quot;, which is probably not what you intended to do.
</p>
<p>
Comparison operators available for &quot;if&quot; and &quot;where&quot; statements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>==  Equal to</li>
<li>!=  Not equal to</li>
<li>&gt; Greater than</li>
<li>&lt; Less than</li>
<li>&gt;= Greater than or equal to</li>
<li>&lt;= Less than or equal to</li>
</ul>
<p>
To do compound conditionals, use || for &quot;or&quot;, and &amp;&amp; for &quot;and&quot;.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
$a = nonzerorand(-9,9) where ($a!=1 &amp;&amp; $a!=-1)
</pre>
<p>
The &quot;if&quot; condition can also be used before or after a code block like this:
</p>
<pre>
$a = rand(0,1)
if ($a==0) {
   $b = 1
   $c = 2
}
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
$a = rand(0,1)
{
   $b = 1
   $c = 2
} if ($a==0)
</pre>
<p>
When &quot;if&quot; is used before a block of code, it can optionally be followed
with &quot;elseif&quot; and/or an &quot;else&quot; statement, like this:
</p>
<pre>
$a = rand(0,5)
if ($a==0) {
   $b = 1
} elseif ($a==2) {
   $b = 3
} else {
   $b = 2
}
</pre>
<p>
&quot;where&quot; can also be applied to a block of code:
</p>
<pre>
{
  $a = rand(-5,-1)
  $b = rand(1,5)
} where ($a+$b !==0)
</pre>

<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
<p>There are several looping macros (such as calconarray) that can meet most needs.  For more general use
there is a "for" loop:</p>

<pre>for ($i=a..b) { action }</pre>
<p>
Here <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> represent whole numbers or variables.  Expressions are not allowed.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
$f = 0
for ($i=1..5) { $f = $f + $i }

$a = rands(1,5,5)
$b = rands(1,5,5)
for ($i=0..4) {
  $c[$i] = $a[$i]*$b[$i]
}
</pre>

<p>Conditions can be used <em>inside</em> a for loop, but not outside without explicit blocking</p>
<pre>for ($i=1..5) {$a = $a+$i if ($i>2) }     WORKS
for ($i=1..5) {$a = $a+$i} if ($a>2)     DOES NOT WORK
{for ($i=1..5) {$a = $a+$i} } if ($a>2)    WORKS
</pre>

<div class=h2>
<h2 id="graphtablemacros">Graph/Table Macros</h2>
The following macros create graphs or tables:
<ul>
<li><strong>showarrays(string,array,[string,array]...,[options])</strong>:  Creates a tabular display of the data in the array(s) as column(s), with the strings
    as column headers.  Alternatively you can call this function with arguments
    showarrays(array of column headers, array of data arrays, [options]).  Options can be a string = "c", "r", or "l" to center, left-align, or right align data,
	  or can be an array with $opts["align"] for alignment, and $opts["caption"] to add a caption to the table.  To align each column differently, provide a
	  a string with a character for each column, like "rcc"</li>
<li><strong>showdataarray(array,[columns])</strong>:  Creates a tabular display of the data in the array with no headers.  Data is presented
    in one column unless second argument is provided, in which case the data will be distributed over the specified number of columns.</li>
<li><strong>horizshowarrays(string,array,[string,array]...)</strong>:  Creates a tabular display of the data in the array(s) as row(s), with the strings
    as row labels.  Does not text wrap, so only use for small data sets.</li>
<li><strong>showrecttable(data array of arrays,columnlabels,rowlabels,[format])</strong>:  Creates a tabular display of a 2x2 data table, where $data[0] is the first row of the table.
    The rowlabels and columnlabels are arrays of labels. format = "c", "r", or "l" to center, left-align, or right align data.</li>
<li><strong>showplot(funcstrings,[xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,labels,grid,width,height])</strong>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>funcstrings</strong> is a single string or an array of strings each having at least the first of the following list:<BR>
	"function,color,min,max,startmarker,endmarker,width,dash"
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Function</strong>: a single function of x, like cos(x), or a parametric function of t, entered like [sin(t),cos(t)], or x=c for a vertical line, entered like x=1</li>
		<li><strong>color</strong>: a color designator: black,red,orange,yellow,green,blue,purple</li>
		<li><strong>min,max</strong>: the min and max values for the input variable for which you wish to see this graph.  You can also exclude
		    point discontinuities; for example -5,5!0!2 for min,max would include all values from -5 to 5, excluding 0 and 2.</li>
		<li><strong>startmarker,endmarker</strong>: can be "open" or "closed" (dots), or anything else for none</li>
		<li><strong>width</strong>: a pixel width for the line</li>
		<li><strong>dash</strong>: enter "dash" if you want a dashed line, otherwise the line is solid</li>
		<li><strong>Examples</strong>: "cos(x),red" or "x^2,,-2,2,open,closed" or "[t^2,t/3],blue,0,5,,,2,dash" or "1/x,black,-5,5!0" or "x=1,red,,,,,,dash"</li>
		<li><strong>Dots and Labels</strong>:  There are two alternate funcstrings formats:
			<ul>
			<li><strong>dots</strong>: For drawing dots. A string containing at least the first three of: "dot,x,y,style,color,label,labelloc"
				<ul>
					<li>dot: the literal word dot</li>
					<li>x,y: the coordinates of the dot</li>
					<li>style: open or closed</li>

				first four of: "text,x,y,label,color,location,angle"
				<ul>
					<li>text: the literal word text</li>
					<li>x,y: the coordinates of the label</li>
					<li>label: the text string to display</li>
					<li>color: a color designator: black,red,orange,yellow,green,blue,purple</li>

				</ul>
			</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><strong>xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax</strong>: Graphing window.  Defaults to -5 to 5 for both. Use "0:-n" (for some value of n) for xmin or ymin to only
	       have gridlines and labels after 0, while still using -n to adjust spacing. This is an alternative to using addplotborder to create
	       first quadrant graphs.</li>
	<li><strong>labels</strong>: spacing of axes labels.  Defaults to 1. Set to "off" or 0 for none.  Use "xlbl:ylbl" for different spacing on each axis.</li>
	<li><strong>grid</strong>: spacing of grid lines.  Defaults to 1.  Set to "off" or 0 for none.  Use "xgrid:ygrid" for different spacing on each axis.</li>
	<li><strong>width,height</strong>:  The width and height (in pixels) of the graph.  Defaults to 200x200</li>
	</ul></li>
<li><strong>mergeplots($plot1, $plot2, [$plot3, $plot4, ...])</strong>: Merges multiple plots into one.  Usually
  	not necessary, since showplot can accept an array of funcstrings, but occasionally useful
  	when adding to a graph generated by another function.  The grid and border from the first
  	graph is used. To avoid weird behavior, try to ensure all plots were drawn using the same
  	grid.</li>
<li><strong>addfractionaxislabels(plot,step)</strong>:  Adds labels along the horizontal axis in steps of step to a plot created with showplot.
      Step is a fraction like "1/4", or a pi multiple, like "pi/4" or "2pi".  When using this, make sure to set the showplot x-axis label
      spacing larger than the domain to prevent the default labels from showing.</li>
<li><strong>addlabel(plot,x,y,label,[color,loc,angle])</strong>: Adds a label to a plot created with showplot.
	<ul>
	<li><strong>plot</strong>: The plot created with showplot</li>
	<li><strong>x,y</strong>: The coordinates for the label</li>
	<li><strong>label</strong>:  The string label itself.  MathML cannot currently be displayed in labels</li>
	<li><strong>color</strong>: Label color.  Defaults to black.</li>
	<li><strong>loc</strong>:  By default, the label is centered at the x,y coordinates.  Use "left" to display the string to the left of the
	point, "right" to the right, "below" for below the point, "above" for above the point.</li>
	<li><strong>angle</strong>: Angle to rotate text.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
<li><strong>addlabelabs(plot,x,y,label,[color,loc,angle])</strong>: Adds a label to a plot created with showplot. Parameters are the same as with
     addlabel, except x and y here are pixel values on the picture rather than values relative to the axes.</li>
<li><strong>addplotborder(plot,left,[bottom,right,top])</strong>:  Changes the pixel width of border (default 5) around a plot.  Labels
    will show within the border.  Typically used to add room for labels to show.</li>
<li><strong>adddrawcommand(plot,commands)</strong>:  Inserts arbitrary asciisvg drawing commands into an existing
    plot created with showplot or other drawing tools.</li>
<li><strong>showasciisvg(string,[width,height,alttext])</strong>:  If you know the ASCIIsvg language, this will set up an svg with "string" as the script.
    optionally you can specify the width and height (in pixels) for the svg.  For accessibility, you should always try to
    include alttext, which is text that displays to people requesting non-visual alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>replacealttext(image or graph, alttext)</strong>: Replaces the alt text (alt tag) in the image or graph with the specified text. This alt text
    will replace the autogenerated textual description for graphs produced by showplot.</li>
<li><strong>changeimagesize(image or graph, width, [height])</strong>: Changes the display width for an image.
    Note this doesn't resize the file itself, just changes the display size - it's always better to resize the original
    image file.</li>
<li><strong>textonimage(img,text,left,top[text,left,top...])</strong>:  Overlays text over an image.  Image can be a URL or the variable for an uploaded
    image.  Specify the text string, and offset in pixels from the top left corner.  Can specify multiple strings to overlay.</li>
<li><strong>arraystodoteqns(xarray,yarray,[color])</strong>:  Converts an array of x-values and y-values into a form that can be used in
  showplot.</li>
<li><strong>connectthedots(xarray,yarray,[color,thickness,startmarker,endmarker])</strong>: Converts an array of x-values and y-values into a form that
  can be used in showplot to create a series of lines connecting the (x,y) pairs</li>
<li><strong>arraystodots(xarray,yarray)</strong>: Converts an array of x-values and y-values into a form that can be used in the Drawing answer type</li>
<li><strong>gettwopointlinedata(stuans, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height])</strong>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing
  question and pulls out the two-point line data.  Returns an array of lines, each of form array(x1,y1,x2,y2) giving the coordinates
  of the two points used.</li>
<li><strong>gettwopointdata(stuans, type, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height])</strong>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing question
  and pulls out the two-point data for the given curve type.  Type should be one of 'line', 'lineseg', 'ray', 'parab', 'horizparab', 'sqrt', 'cubic', 'cuberoot',
  'rationa', 'exp', 'log', 'sin', 'cos', 'abs', 'vector', 'circle'.  Returns an array of curve data, each of form array(x1,y1,x2,y2) giving the coordinates of
  the two points used.  They are returned in the order clicked.  For example, with 'parab' type, the first point is the vertex and the
  second point is an arbitrary point.</li>
<li><strong>getdotsdata(stuans, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height])</strong>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing
  question and pulls out the closed dots data.  Returns an array of dots, each of form array(x1,y1) giving the coordinates
  of the dot.</li>
<li><strong>getopendotsdata(stuans, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height])</strong>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing
  question and pulls out the open dots data.  Returns an array of dots, each of form array(x1,y1) giving the coordinates
  of the dot.</li>
<li><strong>getlinesdata(stuans, [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height])</strong>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing
  question and pulls out the lines data, which includes polygons.  Returns an array, with an element for each line/curve draw.  Each of those
  elements will be an array of points on that line/curve.  Each of those points is array (x,y).</li>
<li><strong>getineqdata(stuans, [type, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height])</strong>:  Takes a $stuanswers from a drawing question
  and pulls out the inequalities data for the given curve type.  Type should be one of 'linear' or 'quadratic'.
	Returns an array of curve data, each of form array(style,x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3) giving the coordinates of
  the three points used.  They are returned in the order clicked.  style will be either 'ne' for strict inequality (dashed line),
	or 'eq' for inequality with equality (solid line).</li>
<li><strong>getsnapwidthheight(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, drawing width, drawing height, snaptogrid)</strong>:  Takes drawing grid info and a snaptogrid
  value or string, and returns an array(width,height) giving a closeby drawing width and height that will guarantee that the snaptogrid values
  fall on exact drawing pixel locations.</li>

<h2 id="formatmacros">Format Macros</h2>

The following macros help with formatting values for display:
<ul>
<li><strong>makepretty(string or array of strings)</strong>: Changes double add/subtract signs to a single sign.</li>
<li><strong>makeprettydisp(string or array of strings)</strong>:  Does makepretty (see above) and backquotes the string for math display</li>
<li><strong>polymakepretty and polymakeprettydisp</strong>:  Like makepretty, but for polynomials.  Cleans up 0*, 1*, ^1, and ^0 to make the polynomial look nicer.
   This function can do weird things for equations that are not simple polynomials, so test well</li>
<li><strong>makexpretty and makexprettydisp</strong>:  (deprecated - use makexxpretty instead) Like makepretty, but the X-tra version - attempts to clean up things like 1*, 0*, etc.  This function
   will often cause weird things to happen, so test well</li>
<li><strong>makexxpretty and makexxprettydisp</strong>:  Like makepretty, but the X-tra version - attempts to clean up things like 1*, 0*, x^1, x^0, etc.  Can occasionally cause strange output, so
   be sure to test.  Handles things better than the older makexpretty, but does not always produce 100% identical output.</li>
<li><strong>numtowords(number,[addth, numwithTh, addcommas)</strong>:  Creates a string containing number written out in words.<br/>
   numtowords(1203) returns "one thousand two hundred three"<br/>
   numtowords(1203,true) returns "one thousand two hundred third"<br/>
   numtowords(1203,false,true) returns "1023rd"<br/>
   numtowords(1203,false,false,true) returns "one thousand, two hundred three"
  </li>
<li><strong>numtoroman(number,[uppercase])</strong>:  Converts a number 0.5-3999.5 to a roman numeral string.  Defaults to uppercase; set second parameter to false to
    produce lowercase</li>
<li><strong>prettyint(number)</strong>:  Adds commas in thousands spaces of integers.  Example: prettyint(1234) will return "1,234".  The result is a string, which
   can only be used for display, not in calculations</li>
<li><strong>prettyreal(number,decimals,[comma])</strong>:  Adds commas in thousands spaces of number, and displays the value to a fixed number of decimals places (rounding if needed).
   Example: prettyreal(1234.567,2) will return "1,234.57", and prettyreal(1.8,3) will return "1.800".  The result is a string, which
   can only be used for display, not in calculations.  By default adds a comma as a thousands separator; set comma to "" to override.</li>
<li><strong>prettysmallnumber(number)</strong>:  Prevents very small numbers from being displayed as scientific notation</li>
<li><strong>prettysigfig(number,sigfigs,[comma,choptrailingzeros])</strong>:  Rounds number to sigfigs significant figures.  By default it adds commas in thousands spaces; set comma to "" override.
   Set choptrailingzeros to true to chop trailing zeros from the decimal part, even if significant.</li>
<li><strong>makescinot(number,[decimals,format])</strong>:  Converts number to scientific notation.  If provided, rounds mantissa to decimals places.  Can specify format: "*" "E" as alternative to default cross.</li>
<li><strong>prettytime(value,informat,outformat)</strong>:  Creates a nice representation of a time.  Informat can be 'h', 'm', or 's' designating whether
    value is hours, minutes, or seconds.  Outformat can be any combination of these to specify output.  For example, 'hm' will return "__ hours and __ minutes".  Outformat
    can also be 'clock' which returns 3:42pm, or 'sclock' which returns 3:42:15pm</li>
<li><strong>dispreducedfraction(numerator,denominator,[doubleslash,variable in numerator])</strong>:  Takes two numbers as numerator and denominator of a fraction, returning a display form of the fraction,
    reduced to lowest terms.  Suitable for $showanswer.  Set doubleslash to true to produced "3//4" rather than "3/4".  Set variable in numerator to put a variable
    in the numerator, such as pi.</li>
<li><strong>makereducedfraction(numerator,denominator,[doubleslash,variable in numerator])</strong>:  Same as dispreducefraction, but not already in display form</li>
<li><strong>decimaltofraction(decimal,[format,maxden])</strong>:  Converts a decimal to a fraction.  Can use format="mixednumber" to get a mixed number rather than improper fraction.
    Only works for denominators up to maxden (default 5000)</li>
<li><strong>htmldisp(string,[variables])</strong>:  Uses HTML instead of the math typesetter to display simple exponents and subscripts, and to italicize variables</li>
</ul>

    step.  Step is optional; it defaults to 1.</li>
<li><strong>calconarray(array,calculation)</strong>:  Returns an array, performing the given calculation on each element of the given array.  Use
    "x" as the variable to represent each element of the array.  Example: $b = calconarray($a,"x^2") will create an array that is the
    square each element of the array $a.</li>
<li><strong>multicalconarray(calculation,varslist,var1array,var2array,etc.)</strong>  Returns an array, performing the given calculation on each set
    of elements from the given arrays.  Allows multivariable calculations.  Example:  $z= multicalconarray("x*y^2","x,y",$xs,$ys)</li>

<li><strong>ifthen(condition,trueval,falseval)</strong>:  Takes a comparision condition, and returns the trueval if the condition is true and the falseval otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>formhoverover(label,tip)</strong>:  Creates a hover-over definition or other tip</li>
<li><strong>formpopup(label,content,[width,height,style,scrollbars])</strong>:  Creates a link or button leading to a popup window.  Content can
  be a web address, or HTML content to put directly into the popup.  Style can be "link" or "button". Scrollbars defaults to false - set true for scrollbars.</li>
<li><strong>forminlinebutton(lable,content,[style,outputstyle])</strong>:  Creates a link or button that when clicked will reveal hidden content.
  Content can be any valid HTML.  Style can be "link" or "button".  Outputstyle can be "inline" or "block".  Block will allow any HTML, but will
  be displayed on a new line.  Use "inline" to have text stay on the same line.</li>
<li><strong>makenumberrequiretimes(array/list)</strong>:  Takes an array or list of numbers and generates a string suitable for use as a $requiretimes.  Writes
  the string so that every number in the array must show up in the student answer.  Automatically detects and adjusts for number overlaps
  (like 2 appearing in 32).</li>
<li><strong>ABarray(start, num)</strong>: Produces an array of strings of the form [AB#] which will get replaced with answerboxes if placed in the question text.
  start is the first value used, and num indicates the number of entries to create.
  ABarray(5,2) will output array("[AB5]","[AB6]").
  This macro is often used in conjunction with the showarrays macro.</li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>

<li><strong>v!</strong>: Factorial, like $a = $b!</li>
<li><strong>evalfunc(func,vars,val1,val2,..)</strong>: Evaluates a function given the variables and values for each variable.
  for example evalfunc("x^2*y","x,y",2,3) will evaluate x^2*y with x=2, y=3</li>
<li>See also: calconarray and multicalconarray in the <a href="#arraymacros">Array Macros</a> section</li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="conditionalmacros">Conditional Test Macros</h2>
These macros are used to test various conditions.  They typically return true or false, depending on whether the desired condition is met.
<ul>
<li><strong>comparenumbers(a,b,[tol])</strong>:  Compares numbers or numerical expressions a and b to see if there are equivalent to the specified
  tolerance.  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>comparefunctions(a,b,[vars,tol,domain])</strong>: Compares functions a and b to see if they are algebraically equivalent.  Set
  vars to a list of variables (defaults to 'x').  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.
  Set domain to "xmin,xmax" to specify a domain for comparison.</li>
<li><strong>is_numeric(str)</strong>:  Checks if the string represents an integer or decimal number.</li>
<li><strong>scorestring($answer,$showanswer,words,$stuanswers,$thisq,[partn, highlight])</strong>: This function checks
  to see if the words in the list/array "words" appear in the student's answer. If they all appear, it redefines
  $answer and $showanswer so the student's answer is marked correct.
  For multipart questions, include the part number as an
  additional parameter.  Usage for single part questions (where $words is predefined earlier in the code):<br/>
  $answer,$showanswer = scorestring($answer,"",$words,$stuanswers,$thisq)<Br/>
  Usage for multipart questions (again where $words is predefined). This is example is for part 2: <br/>
  $answer,$showanswer = scorestring($answer,$showanswer,$words,$stuanswers,$thisq,2)</li>
  </ul>
</div> <!-- h2 -->
<div class=h2>
<h2 id="feedbackmacros">Feedback Macros</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>getfeedbackbasic(correct msg, incorrect msg, $thisq, [partnum])</strong>:  Generates a feedback string based solely on whether the
  question was scored correct or not.  Provide the correct and incorrect messages to display, and provide $thisq.  Give a part number for
  multipart questions to get part-based feedback.</li>
<li><strong>getfeedbacktxt(stuans, feedbacktxt, ans)</strong>:  Gives feedback on multiple choice questions.  <br/>
  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from
   $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart. <br/>
   feedbacktxt is an array of feedback responses, corresponding     in array order to the $questions, so feedbacktxt[1] is the feedback

<li><strong>getfeedbacktxtessay(stuans, feedbacktxt)</strong>:  Gives feedback on essay questions.  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from
   $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.  It is not actually evaluated or compared - it is only
   needed to see if the student has entered a response or not.  Once the student has entered any response, feedbacktxt will be returned.</li>
<li><strong>getfeedbacktxtnumber(stuans, partialcredit, feedbacktxt, defaultfeedback, [tol])</strong>:  Gives feedback on number questions.  <br/>
  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.  For Calculated

  stuans should be the student answer, obtained from $stuanswers[$thisq] for single part questions, or using the getstuans macro for multipart.  <br>
  stuansval should be the numerical value of the student answer, obtained from $stuanswersval[$thisq]. <br/>
  partialcredit is an array or list of form array(number, score, number, score, ... ) where the scores are in the range [0,1].  <br/>
  feedbacktxt is an array of feedback messages, corresponding in array order to the order of the numbers in the partialcredit list.<br/>
  defaultfeedback is the default incorrect response feedback <br/>
  answerformat can be a single answerformat to apply to all expressions, or an array with each element applied to the corresponding expression<br/>
  requiretimes can be a single requiretimes to apply to all expressions, or an array with each element applied to the corresponding expression<br/>
  Set tol to specify the relative tolerance (defaults to .001), or prefix with | for an absolute tolerance.<br/>
  Example: <code>getfeedbacktxtcalculated($stuanswers[$thisq], $stuanswersval[$thisq], array("1/2",1,"1/2",.5), array("Correct", "Right value, but give your answer as a fraction"), "Incorrect", array("fraction",""))</code>
    will check the students answer against the answer "1/2" twice, the first time applying the "fraction" answerformat, and the second time not.</li>
<li><strong>getfeedbacktxtnumfunc(stuans, partialcredit, feedbacktxt, defaultfeedback, [vars, requiretimes, tol, domain])</strong>:  Gives feedback on numfunc (algebric expression/equation) questions.  <br/>

<h2 id="solver">Solver</h2>
<p>
While writing a question, it can be handy to quickly solve a formula for a variable.  For example, if you're writing a question that asks students to solve y=($a x + $b)/($b x - $a) for x, where $a and $b are randomized variables.  You might need to calculate the correct answer.  The Solver tool can help solve or check the solution.

<h2 id="writingcommon">Common options to all types</h2>
<p>
All question types can support these options:
</p>
<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>For a single question (not multipart), to use hints, in the common control (or question control) section define the array $hints where:</p>
<pre>$hints[attempt number] = "hint text"</pre>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
$hints[0] = "This will show on first display"
$hints[1] = "This will show on second attempt (after 1 missed attempt)"
$hints[2] = "This will show on third and subsequent attempts, since no later values have been defined"
</pre>
<p>
It is fine, for example, to not define $hints[0] if you want nothing to display initially.
</p>
<p>
Then in the question text, place the location of the hint using the variable $hintloc.
</p>

<p>
In multipart questions, you can follow the process above if you just want a single strand of hints for the entire problem.  If you want per-part hints, define the $hints array as:
</p>
<pre>
$hints[question part number][attempt number] = "hint text"
</pre>
<p>
Then in question text, place each hint using $hintloc[question part number]
</p>
<p>
To override the default <em>Hint:</em> text, set $hintlabel.
</p>

<h3>Help references</h3>
<p>To provide help of some sort for a question (typically, links to videos, book references, etc), define $helptext
in the common control section.  Any text assigned to this variable will show above the answer box entry tips.  The
display of this text is controlled by the same "show hints?" option that controls the display of hints described above.</p>


<h3>Referencing Student Answers</h3>
<p>To create multipart questions that are graded on consistency, or to create a set of lab-type problems that rely on student-provided data, you can reference
students' previous answers in your question code.  You will only be able to reference the student answer to some question types</p>
<ul>
<li>$stuanswers[N] will refer to the student's answer on question N (not zero-indexed: N=1 is question 1)</li>
<li>$stuanswers[N][P] will refer to the student's answer on question N, part P (if multipart)</li>
<li>$stuanswers[$thisq][P] will refer to the student's answer on the current question, part P</li>
<li>$stuanswers[$thisq-1] will refer to the student's answer on the previous question</li>
<li>$stuanswersval[$thisq] or $stuanswersval[$thisq][P] will contain the numerical value of Calculated question types.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Notes (important!):
</p>
<p>
1) If the student has not answered the question, then $stuanswers[N] === null, with the exception of drop-down select
questions, where $stuanswers[N] == "NA" if no selection is made.
If used in an equation, it will take on the value 0.
To prevent divide-by-zero errors and to prevent students from exploiting this, it is highly recommended that you do something like:
</p>
<pre>
$a = $stuanswers[$thisq][0]
$a = rand(1,100) if ($a===null)
</pre>
<p>
Perhaps also include:
$warning = "You MUST answer question 1 before this question" if ($a===null), then put $warning in the question text.
</p>
<p>
2) If you use $stuanswers in your $answer, $showanswer will generally not be defined.  If you follow the advice in #1 above, then your
$showanswer will reflect the random number assigned to $a.  For this reason, it is highly recommended that you custom define the $showanswer.
</p>
<p>
3) If using the $stuanswers array in a string or in the Question Text, you must enclose it with curly brackets:
Your answer was {$stuanswers[0][0]}.  If using it directly in a calculation, enclose it in parentheses just to be safe.
</p>
<p>
4) $stuanswers[$thisq] is defined for question scoring, but may not be for question display.
</p>
<p>
5) You can use the function getstuans($stuanswers,N,P) to retreive a student answer value.  This method bypasses some strange things that happen
when there is a multipart question with only one part, so is recommended.
</p>

<h3>Other Reference Variables</h3>
<p>A few other special purpose variables can be referenced:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$scorenonzero</strong>: This variable is only available on display, not during scoring. $scorenonzero[$thisq] (or $scorenonzero[$thisq][partindex] for multipart)
   will be -1 if the question is unanswered, 0 if the score is zero, and 1 if the score is anything above 0.</li>
<li><strong>$scoreiscorrect</strong>: This variable is only available on display, not during scoring. $scoreiscorrect[$thisq] (or $scoreiscorrect[$thisq][partindex] for multipart)
   will be -1 if the question is unanswered, 1 if the score (before any penalties) is perfect, and 0 otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>$attemptn</strong>: This variable holds the attempt number of the current attempt.  0 is the initial attempt, 1 is the next attempt, etc.</li>
<li><strong>$requestclearla</strong>:  If you set $requestclearla=true in your code, it will request the display to clear out the student's last answer.
  This might be useful if your question branches based on attempt count.  Example: <code>$requestclearla = true if ($attemptn==2 &amp;&amp; !$scoreiscorrect[$thisq])</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Reusing Code</h3>
<p>You can import in the Common Control code from another question using</p>
<pre>includecodefrom(questionid)</pre>
<p>
where questionid is the ID number of the question you want to import the code of.  In the
source question, the variable $included will automatically be set to true when the question
has been included, so it can be used to determine if the question has been
imported into another question, or is running independently.
</p>
<p>For example, in the master/source question, you might use the code:</p>
<pre>
if (!$included) {
 $type = rand(0,4)
}
do stuff here
</pre>
<p>
In a question using this code, you could limit to a specific type using:
</p>
<pre>
$type = 0
includecodefrom(1234)
</pre>
<p>Question text can be also brought in from another question by using</p>
<pre>includeqtextfrom(questionid)</pre>
<p>
somewhere in the Question Text portion of the question.

The question types available are:

<div class=h3>
<h3 id="number">Number</h3>
<p>
The student is asked to enter a number (integer, decimal, or scientific notation).
The answer is compared to a given tolerance.  Can also accept DNE, oo (Infinity), and
-oo (Negative Infinity) as answers.
</p>
<p><strong>Required Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$answer = a number or calculation resulting in a number, like $answer = 5 </dt>
	<dd>Defines the answer.  Define multiple acceptable answers in a string separated by or:  $answer = "3 or 5 or 7".
	Alternatively, you can provide an interval notation range of
	acceptable answers, like $answer = "(2,5]".  Providing a range will override any tolerances set.  If $answerformat is set
	for list answers, then this should provide a list of correct answers, like $answer = "1,2,3".</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Optional Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$reltolerance = a decimal value </dt>
	<dd>Defines the largest relative error that will be accepted.  If this is not set, a relative error of .001 (.1%) is
	used by default.</dd>
<dt>$abstolerance = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the largest absolute error that will be accepted.  This will override the use of $reltolerance</dd>
<dt>$reqdecimals = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the minimum decimal accuracy required (ie 2 for two decimal places).  This will put a message in the answer tips stating the
	decimals required.  If neither $abstolerance or $reltolerance is set, this will set the tolerance, otherwise the provided tolerance
	will be used (even if it doesn't agree with the $reqdecimal setting).<br/><br/>
	$reqdecimals = "=2" can be used to require exactly 2 decimal places in the answer, regardless of how the value rounds (so 3.5 would get marked
	wrong when the answer is 3.50 if "=2" is used).  If you use the "=2" form, it will also round your $answer if needed for the $showanswer.
	<br/>When the "=2" form is used, it overrides both $reltolerance and $abstolerance, and by default tests that the student answer exactly matches
	the correct answer ($abstolerance=0).  To override the tolerance use +- in the setting, like this:
	<br/>$reqdecimals = "=2+-.01" checks for exactly 2 decimals, but allows the answer to have an absolute error of .01
	<br/>$reqdecimals = "=2+-1%" checks for exactly 2 decimals, but allows the answer to have an relative error of 1% (equivalent to $relatolerance = .01)</dd>
<dt>$reqsigfigs = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the significant figure accuracy required.  Use $reqsigfigs = 2 for at least 2 sig fig accuracy, or
	$reqsigfigs = "=2" to require exactly 2 sig figs in the answer, or $reqsigfigs = "[2,3]" to require 2 or 3 sigfigs.  This will put also a message in the answer tips stating the
	significant figures required.  If you use the "=2" form, it will also round your $answer if needed for the $showanswer.
	<br/>This setting overrides both $reltolerance and $abstolerance, and by default tests that the student answer rounded to the specified sigfigs matches
	the correct answer.  To override the tolerance use +- in the setting, like this:
	<br/>$reqsigfigs = "=2+-.01" checks for exactly 2 sigfigs, but allows the answer to have an absolute error of .01
	<br/>$reqsigfigs = "=2+-1%" checks for exactly 2 sigfigs, but allows the answer to have an relative error of 1% (equivalent to $relatolerance = .01)</dd>
<dt>$answerformat = "list", "exactlist", "orderedlist", "integer, "nosoln", or "nosolninf"</dt>
	<dd>$answerformat = "list", "exactlist", or "orderedlist" specifies that a list of answers is expected.  If $answerformat="list", then duplicate values are ignored.  If $answerformat="exactlist",
	then duplicate values are not ignored.  If $answerformat="orderedlist", the list must be in the same order and contain identical counts of values.
	<br/>$answerformat = "integer" changes the entry hint to only indicate integers, and rejects answers that contain decimals (except it does allow 2.0 instead of 2)
	<br/>$answerformat = "nosoln" or "nosolninf" adds a list radio buttons for "no solutions" and optionally "infinite solutions". $ansprompt can override the default statements like this:
	$ansprompt = "One value, x=;No values;Many values"
	<br/>Answerformats can be combined, like $answerformat = "nosoln,list"</dd>
<dt>$partialcredit = array(number,score,[number,score,...]) </dt>
	<dd>Allows you to specify partial credit for other answers.  The array should be given in the form array(number,score,number,score,...), where
	number is the value to compare to the student answer, and score is a proportion between 0 and 1 to award as partial credit.  Note this
	currently only works for single number answers; "or" and list answers are not supported.</dd>
<dt>$ansprompt = string </dt>
	<dd>A string that will be displayed in front of the input box.  Example: $ansprompt="y="</dd>
<dt>$displayformat = "alignright" </dt>
	<dd>Aligns the text in the answer box to the right side</dd>
<dt>$answerboxsize = number </dt>
	<dd>Determines the number of characters space provided for entry of an answer.  Defaults to 20.</dd>
<dt>$answerbox (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>Using the variable $answerbox in the Question Text will place the question input box in that location</dd>
<dt>$showanswer </dt>
	<dd>The answer to show to students (if option if available).  Defaults to $answer.  Use this to give a detailed answer,
	or a rounded off answer.</dd>
<dt>$hidetips = true </dt>
	<dd>Hides the question entry tips that display by default.
This should only be used when a question type is being used in an unintentional way,
or if the question type gives away critical info to the student.</dd>

<div class=h3>
<h3 id="calculated">Calculated</h3>
<p>
A student is asked to enter a number or a calculation, like 2/3, 5^2, or sin(2).  Can also accept DNE, oo (Infinity), and
-oo (Negative Infinity) as answers.
</p>
<p><strong>Required Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$answer = a number or calculation resulting in a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the answer.  Define multiple acceptable answers in a string separated by or:  $answer = "3 or 5 or 7".
	Alternatively, you can provide an interval notation range of
	acceptable answers, like $answer = "(2,5]".  Providing a range will override any tolerances set<br/><br/>
	To have the answer display as a rendered expression, provide the answer as a string.  For example, if you want the answer to show as 2<sup>4</sup> then
	you'd specify $answer = "2^4".  If you specified $answer = 2^4, the answer would display as 16.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Optional Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$answerformat = "fraction", or one of the other options below.</dt>
	<dd>Specifies answer format options.  Some can be combined in a list, like this: $answerformat="nodecimal,notrig".
	<ul>
	<li>Base format types: only use at most one of these at a time
		<ul>
		<li>fraction: requires the answer to be a single fraction (like 10/6, 1/3, or 5)</li>
		<li>reducedfraction: a reduced fraction (like 5/3 or 5)</li>
		<li>mixednumber: a reduced mixed number (like 2 1/2 or 2_1/2, or 2/3 or 5)</li>
		<li>mixednumberorimproper: a reduced mixed number or improper fraction (like 2 1/2 or 5/2)</li>
		<li>sloppymixednumber: a mixed number (will take 5/2, 2 1/2, even 1 3/2)</li>
		<li>scinot: scientific notation (like 2.3*10^4)</li>
		<li>scinotordec: scientific notation (like 2.3*10^4) or decimal value</li>
		<li>fracordec: a single fraction or decimal value.  Can be combined with "allowmixed" to also allow mixed numbers.</li>
		<li>decimal: requires the answer to be an integer or decimal value</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Mix-ins:  You can add these as needed to modify what's allowed
		<ul>
		<li>allowunreduced: can be combined with "mixednumber" or "mixednumberorimproper" to allow unreduced fractional parts</li>
		<li>allowxtimes: allows the use of x for multiplication (like 23x10^2 for 23*10^2), typically in combo with the "scinot" format</li>
		<li>nodecimal: require an answer without decimals (also disallows 10^-2 and 3E-2)</li>
		<li>notrig: require an answer without trig functions (sin,cos,tan,sec,csc,cot)</li>
		<li>allowmixed: will enable support for mixed numbers (like 2 1/2) in answers</li>
		<li>noval: tells the answer preview to not compute a decimal equivalent (deprecated - this option is now enabled by default)</li>
		<li>showval: tells the answer preview to display a decimal equivalent</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>List options: only use at most one of these at a time
		<ul>
		<li>list:  a list of answers is expected - ignores duplicate values (1,1,2 is equivalent to 1,2)</li>
		<li>exactlist: a list of answers is expected - does not ignore duplicates</li>
		<li>orderedlist: a list of answers is expected - order is important, and duplicates are not ignored</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Special options:
		<ul>
		<li>nosoln: adds radio buttons for "no solutions". Use $answer="DNE" if the answer is no solutions.</li>
		<li>nosolninf: adds radio buttons for "no solutions" and "infinite solutions".  Use $answer="DNE" or $answer="oo" respectively if needed.</li>
		<li>To override the default "no solutions" and "infinite solutions" wording, you can define $ansprompt as a list of semicolon-delimited strings
		    to override the default wording.  For example, <br/><code>$ansprompt = "One value, x=;No values;Many values"</code></li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
<dt>$formatfeedbackon = true</dt>
	<dd>Turns on "right answer, wrong format" feedback on the question</dd>
<dt>$reltolerance = a decimal value </dt>
	<dd>Defines the largest relative error that will be accepted.  If this is not set, a relative error of .001 (.1%) is
	used by default.</dd>
<dt>$abstolerance = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the largest absolute error that will be accepted.  This will override the use of $reltolerance</dd>
<dt>$reqdecimals = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the decimal accuracy required (ie 2 for two decimal places).  This will put a message in the answer tips stating the
	decimals required.  If neither $abstolerance or $reltolerance is set, this will set the tolerance, otherwise the provided tolerance
	will be used (even if it doesn't agree with the $reqdecimal setting).</dd>
<dt>$reqsigfigs = a number </dt>
	<dd>Defines the significant figure accuracy required.  Only valid for "decimal", "scinot", and "scinotordec" $answerformat options.
	Use $reqsigfigs = 2 for at least 2 sig fig accuracy, or
	$reqsigfigs = "=2" to require exactly 2 sig figs in the answer, or $reqsigfigs = "[2,3]" to require 2 or 3 sigfigs.  This will put also a message in the answer tips stating the
	significant figures required.  If you use the "=2" form, it will also round your $answer if needed for the $showanswer.
	<br/>This setting overrides both $reltolerance and $abstolerance, and by default tests that the student answer rounded to the specified sigfigs matches
	the correct answer.  To override the tolerance use +- in the setting, like this:
	<br/>$reqsigfigs = "=2+-.01" checks for exactly 2 sigfigs, but allows the answer to have an absolute error of .01
	<br/>$reqsigfigs = "=2+-1%" checks for exactly 2 sigfigs, but allows the answer to have an relative error of 1% (equivalent to $relatolerance = .01)</dd>

<dt>$requiretimes = a list, like "^,=3,cos,&lt;2" </dt>
	<dd>Adds format checking to the student's answer.  The list can include multiple checks, which come in pairs.  The
	first is the symbol to look for.  The second describes what is acceptable.  For example, in the string shown above,
	the symbol "^" would be required to show up exactly 3 times, and "cos" would be required to show up less than 2 times. <br/>
	Be aware that if you search for "5,=1", it will match both 5 and 15 and 2.5, since all three strings contain a 5.  When
	searching for numbers, you can avoid this by putting a "#" before the number, like "#5,=1", which would match the 5 but not 15 or 0.5.
	Beware this type of search ignores signs.<br/>
	You can	use just "#" in the symbol location to match any number (including decimal values); 3.2^5 would match twice.<br/>
	You can match either of two symbols by putting || between them, like ".5||1/2,>0"<br/>
	You can use a regular expression by putting in the symbol location "regex:expression"<br/>
	You can put "ignore_commas,true" at the beginning of the $requiretimes to ignore commas in the answer<br/>
	You can put "ignore_symbol,$" (or some symbol other than $) at the beginning of the $requiretimes to ignore that symbol in the answer
	</dd>
<dt>$requiretimeslistpart = a list, in the same format as $requiretimes </dt>
	<dd>Similar to $requiretimes, but this check is applied to each element of the answer list when a list $answerformat is used,
	where $requiretimes would be applied to the entire list of answers.  To apply different $requiretimes to each element of the $answer list, separate
	them with semicolons, like "pi,=1;/,=1;;"</dd>
<dt>$ansprompt = string </dt>
	<dd>A string that will be displayed in front of the input box.  Example: $ansprompt="y="</dd>
<dt>$answerboxsize = number </dt>
	<dd>Determines the number of characters space provided for entry of an answer.  Defaults to 20.</dd>
<dt>$hidepreview = true </dt>
	<dd>Hides the Preview button.  Could be useful in multipart questions, or if you're only asking for a simple
	response, like a fraction</dd>
<dt>$answerbox (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>Using the variable $answerbox in the Question Text will place the question input box in that location</dd>
<dt>$showanswer </dt>
	<dd>The answer to show to students (if option if available).  Defaults to $answer.  Use this to give a detailed answer,
	or a rounded off answer.</dd>
<dt>$previewloc (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>Where you want the preview button to be located.  Defaults to after the entry box if not placed in question text.</dd>
<dt>$hidetips = true </dt>
	<dd>Hides the question entry tips that display by default.
This should only be used when a question type is being used in an unintentional way,

A student is asked to enter a function
<p><strong>Required Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$answer = string </dt>
	<dd>Defines the answer function, entered as a string.  For example, $answer="2sin(x)".  You can
	specify multiple acceptable answers by separating with "or", like $answer="x^2 or x^4"<br/>
	Note: The system will accept any algebraically equivalent answer. To only allow answers of a
	specific format, you'll also need to define $requiretimes (see below).</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Optional Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$variables = string </dt>
	<dd>A list of all variables in the function (including letters representing constants).  Defaults to "x".  Can use
	"f()" to indicate a symbol represents a function.</dd>
<dt>$domain = "inputmin,inputmax" </dt>
	<dd>Defines the domain on which to compare the given answer and correct answer functions.  The same domain
	applies to all variables.  An option third list element "integers" can be given, which limits the domain to integer
	values.  The domain defaults to real numbers from -10 to 10.  If using multiple variables, can extend domain to
	define domain for each variable separately.  Example: $variables = "x,y"; $domain = "0,5,20,25"</dd>
<dt>$requiretimes = a list, like "^,=3,cos,&lt;2" </dt>
	<dd>Adds format checking to the student's answer.  The list can include multiple checks, which come in pairs.  The
	first is the symbol to look for.  The second describes what is acceptable.  For example, in the string shown above,
	the symbol "^" would be required to show up exactly 3 times, and "cos" would be required to show up less than 2 times.  You can
	use "#" in the symbol location to match any number (including decimal values); 3.2x+42y would match twice.<br/>
	You can use a regular expression by putting in the symbol location "regex:expression"<br/>
	You can match either of two symbols by putting || between them, like "x^-3||/x^3,>0"<br/>
	Include "ignore_case,false" to make the search case sensitive.
	Include "ignore_symbol,$" (or some symbol other than $) at the beginning of the $requiretimes to ignore that symbol in the answer<br/>
	Note that commas are ignored by default with Function type, and a basic exponent like x^(-3) is converted to x^-3 before the check.</dd>
<dt>$answerformat = "equation" or "toconst" or "nosoln" or "nosolninf" (can combine, like "equation,nosoln")</dt>
	<dd>By default, the student answer is expected to be an expression, and be equivalent (at points) to the specified answer.  This option changes
	this behavior.<br/>
	"equation": Specifies that the answer expected is an equation rather than an expression.  The given
	answer should also be an equation.  Be sure to specify all variables in the equation in $variables.  This may fail
	on equations that are near zero for most values of the input; this can often be overcome by changing the $domain<br/>
	"toconst": Specifies that the answer provided by the student is allowed to differ from the specified answer by a constant
	for all inputs.  Appropriate for comparing antiderivatives.  This may fail on expressions that evaluate to very large
	values or raise numbers to very large powers.<br/>
	"nosoln" or "nosolninf" adds a list radio buttons for "no solutions" and optionally "infinite solutions".

	<dd>Determines how the string will be compared.  Set to 1 to turn on, 0 for off.  Flags are:
		<ul>
		<li>ignore_case: ignores capitol/lowercase differences</li>
		<li>trim_whitespace: trims leading and ending whitespace (spaces)</li>
		<li>compress_whitespace: compresses multiple spaces to one space and trims</li>
		<li>remove_whitespace: removes all whitespace (spaces)</li>
		<li>ignore_order: treats ABC and CBA as equivalent</li>
		<li>ignore_commas: removes commas</li>
		<li>partial_credit: awards partial credit based on Levenshtein distance between strings</li>
		<li>allow_diff=n: gives full credit for answers with Levenshtein distance between strings &le; n </li>
		<li>in_answer: gives credit if $answer is contained anywhere in the student answer</li>
		<li>regex: interprets $answer as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Ov1JUMDv4">regular expression</a> (pattern) to evaluate the student's answer.  For example, $answer="cost.*increas" will give credit if the word <em>cost</em> appears before <em>increas</em> in the student's answer.  $answer="increas|ris" will accept any of the following: <em>increas</em>ing, <em>increas</em>es, <em>ris</em>ing, or <em>ris</em>en etc.</li>

<dt>$anstypes = an array or list of answer types </dt>
	<dd>Defines the answer type for each part.  Example:
	$anstypes = array("number","number","choices")<br/>
	Refer to this list for the short names of each question type:
	<ul>
	<li>Number:  "number"</li>
	<li>Calculated: "calculated"</li>
	<li>Multiple Choice: "choices"</li>
	<li>Multiple Answer: "multans"</li>

	<li>String: "string"</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
<dt>Question part variables</dt>
	<dd>For each question part, you will need to define the variables (like $answer, $questions, etc.) you would normally
	need to define.  However, you will need to suffix the variable with a part designator.  For example, based on $anstypes
	above, the first answer is a number.  Instead of $answer = 5, enter $answer[0] = 5.  This designates that this answer belongs
	to the first element of $anstypes.  Likewise, to set the variables for the "numfunc" type, you'd set $variables[5] = "x".</dd>
<dt>$answerbox[partnum] (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>The array $answerbox will contain the entry boxes for each answer type.  In the question text, you will need to position
	these boxes within the question.  For example:  "Enter a number: $answerbox[0].  Now a function: $answerbox[1]".  Alternatively, you
	can use [AB#]: "Enter a number: [AB0].  Now a function: [AB1]" </dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Optional Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$answeights = an array or list of weights for each question </dt>
	<dd>By default the points for a problem are divided evenly over the parts.  Use this option if you wish to weight parts
	differently.  Example: $answeights = array(.2,.3,.5).  Best practice is to use percents, but if other values are used, they will
	be converted to percents.</dd>
<dt>$scoremethod = "singlescore" or "allornothing" </dt>
	<dd>Instead of recording individual scores for each question part, these will cause a single score to be
	recorded for the question.  "singlescore" totals the individual part scores, while "allornothing"
	will only give full credit or no credit.</dd>
<dt>Question part options</dt>
	<dd>You can define any optional variable for each question part.  Like above, suffix the variable with the part designator.</dd>
<dt>$showanswer </dt>
	<dd>You can either define $showanswer for individual question parts (ie, $showanswer[1]="`x^2`"), or you can set one
	$showanswer, which will be the only answer shown for the problem (ie, $showanswer = "x=$answer[0], y=$answer[1]")</dd>
<dt>$showanswerloc (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>Optionally, you can use $showanswerloc to place a single $showanswer "Show Answer" button,
	or $showanswerloc[part] to place "Show Answer" buttons for each part.  You can also use short tags
	of the form [SAB] or [SABn] (like [SAB2]). Note that if you use this to place one
	Show Answer button, you must place all of them, or else the remainder will not show.  Use $showanswerstyle = 'inline' to
	allow Show Answer to be placed inline with text rather than on its own line.</dd>

</div> <!-- h3 -->
<div class=h3>
<h3 id="conditional">Conditional</h3>
A variation on multipart questions, a conditional question can include multiple answer boxes, but assigns
a single score.  The score is based on applying some comparison or conditional test to the student answers, referenced through
the <a href="#writingcommon">$stuanswers</a> array.  This allows the question writer to essentially create their
own question type.
<p><strong>Required Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>$anstypes = an array or list of answer types</dt>
	<dd>Defines the answer type for each part.  Example: $anstypes = "number,number".  See the Multipart help above
	for the list of short names</dd>
<dt>$answer = any of these:</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>A boolean (true/false) expression</strong>: Something that evaluates to true or false. <br/>
	Example: $answer = ($a>3) <br/>
	Example: $answer = comparefunctions($f,'x^2') &amp;&amp; ($a!=0)</li>
	<li><strong>A single numerical value</strong> in the interval [0,1]: will award that percentage of the total possible points.</li>
	<li><strong>array('function',$a,$b)</strong>:  Will compare the functions $a and $b and mark the question correct if they
	   are equivalent.  Can set $variables, $reltolerance, $abstolerance, and $domain as needed, like with Function type
	   questions</li>
	<li><strong>array('number',$a,$b)</strong>:  Will compare the numbers or numerical expressions $a and $b and mark the question correct if they
	   are equivalent.  Can set $reltolerance or $abstolerance as needed, like with Number/Calculated type
	   questions</li>
	<li><strong>Multiple comparisons</strong>: You can mix the two types above by creating an array of comparions.  All must be true
	   for the question to be marked correct.  <br/>
	   Example: $answer = array($a>3, array('function',$b,c), array('number',evalfunc($b,$a),5))</li>
	</ul>
<dt>Question part variables</dt>
	<dd>For each question part, you will need to define the variables (like $questions, etc.) you would normally
	need to define, except you <strong>should not</strong> define an $answer.  However, you will need to suffix the variable with
	a part designator.  For example, based on $anstypes
	above, the first answer is a number.  Instead of $displayformat = "select", enter $displayformat[0] = "select".
	This designates that this setting belongs
	to the first element of $anstypes.
	</dd>
<dt>$answerbox[partnum] (In Question Text)</dt>
	<dd>The array $answerbox will contain the entry boxes for each answer type.  In the question text, you will need to position
	these boxes within the question.  For example:  "Enter a number: $answerbox[0].  Now a function: $answerbox[5]"</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Optional Variables</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>Question part options</dt>
	<dd>You can define any optional variable for each question part.  Like above, suffix the variable with the part designator.
	Note that $variables, $domain, $reltolerance, and $abstolerance may be used for the comparison, and should not be set for
	individual parts.</dd>
<dt>$showanswer</dt>
	<dd>By default the $showanswer for conditional types is "Answers may vary".  Set $showanswer to override this.</dd>

<h4 id="accessibility">Accessibility and Display Preferences</h4>
<p>
The Accessibility and Display Preferences in the user profile allow you to personalize
how you interact with the system, and allow you to work around technical issues.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Math Display</strong>: This option allows you to customize how math equations
	are displayed in the system.
	<ul>
	<li>MathJax: The recommended default is MathJax, which
	generates high quality display of math and provides the best compatibility
	with screenreaders and other assistive technology. </li>
	<li>Katex: provides faster math display with good quality, but not quite
	as nice as MathJax.</li>
	<li>Image-based: this uses images to display math. The quality is not as
	good, but this option can help workaround issue if the browser is having
	trouble using MathJax.</li>
	<li>Calculator-style: this uses an inline, text-based, calculator style
	display, like <code>x^2+4sqrt(x)</code>.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Graph Display</strong>: This option allows you to customize how graphs are
 	displayed in the system.
 	<ul>
	<li>SVG: The recommended default, this is the highest quality display,
	which will look clear and sharp even when zoomed in.</li>
	<li>Image-based: this option uses images to display graphs. The quality
	is not as high and will look fuzzy if zoomed in.</li>
	<li>Text alternatives: this option will replace auto-generated graphs
	with a text alternative, typically a table of values for the equations or
	a text description of a chart.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Drawing Entry</strong>: This option controls how answers to drawing questions
 	are entered.
 	<ul>
	<li>Mouse-based: The default, a mouse or touch device is used to plot
	points on a graph to create the drawing.</li>
	<li>Keyboard and text alternative: this option provides a text-based
	alternative for drawing entry, which can also be controlled entirely
	using the keyboard.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Text Editor</strong>: This option controls how large text entry is done.
 	<ul>
	<li>Rich text editor: The default, this option provides an editor
	with formatting buttons and "what you see is what you get" editing.</li>
	<li>Plain text entry: this option provides a basic text entry box with
	no buttons or other clutter.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Course styling and contrast</strong>: This option allows you to customize
 	the contrast styling of the course.
 	<ul>
	<li>Instructor chosen theme: The default, this option uses the instructor
	chosen styles for the course.</li>
	<li>High contrast, dark on light: this option overrides the course styles
	with extra-high-contrast styles, featuring dark text on a light background.</li>
	<li>High contrast, light on dark: this option overrides the course styles
	with extra-high-contrast styles, featuring white text on a dark background.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Live preview</strong>: This option controls how the preview of your answers updates
 	as you type.
 	<ul>
	<li>Show as I type: This default option will auto-update a preview of your
	answer as you type it out.  This can help you catch entry mistakes early.</li>
	<li>Only show a preview when I click: this option will stop the auto-update
	of a preview, and only display the preview when you request it. This option
	can reduce the distraction and flicker of the auto-update.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li><strong>Time Zone</strong>: This option allows you to control the time zone that due
 	dates and other times are displayed based on.
 	<ul>
	<li>Use timezone reported by browser: When you log in, the system asks
	your computer what time zone you're in. By default, this timezone is the
	one used when displaying dates. You can check the listed timezone to make
	sure it's the correct one. If it is wrong, you can either adjust your
	computer's timezone then log out and back in, or override the detected time zone.</li>
	<li>Use a specific timezone for this session: this option allows you to override
	the detected timezone for this one login session. The next time you log in, the system
	will again detect your currect timezone. This option can be helpful if you don't
	want to change your computer's clock, but want to adjust the timezone temorarily.</li>
	<li>Always show times based on specific timezone: this option allows you to override
	the detected timezone every time you log in. This can be helpful if you
	travel a lot, but always want the times to display based on your home
	timezone.</li>

<h2 id="stucalendar">Calendar</h2>

<p>
Many courses will have a Calendar link which will display a calendar showing
upcoming due dates and other special events.  You can click on a specific day to
view a more detailed listing of the events for that day.  You can use that
list to access assignments and other items.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that not everything from the course will display on the calendar,
so be sure to actually look at the course page, not just rely on the calendar.
</p>
<p>
The color of the items on the calendar will change based on how far away the due
date is; items in green are futher away, items in yellow are closer, and items
in red are approaching the due date.
</p>

<div class=h2>
<h2 id="coursemap">Course Map</h2>

<p>
The course page will have a link to the Course Map, a condensed list view
of everything in the course.  The Course Map can help you locate items in the
course that are buried in folders.

<h2 id="takingassessments">Taking Assessments</h2>
When you take an assessment, it will be displayed to you in one of several ways:
<ul>
<li><strong>Full Test</strong>:  You may see the entire test at once</li>
<li><strong>One at a time</strong>:  You may have to answer one question before proceeding to the next</li>
<li><strong>Full test, submit one at a time</strong>:  The full test is displayed, but you only answer one question at a time</li>
<li><strong>Skip Around</strong>:  You may see a list of questions.  You can skip around between questions by clicking on these links,
  and answer the questions in any order.</li>
</ul>

There are several question types.  When you click on the answer box, a hint will typically display below it telling you
what kind of answer is expected.  Some of the types:
<ul>
<li><strong>Number</strong>:  You will be asked to enter a number, like 3, 5.5, or -6</li>
<li><strong>Calculated</strong>:  You will be asked to enter a number, or a calculation, like 2/3, 5^2, or sin(2).  You can
    press the "Preview" button to ensure that the system is interpreting your answer the way you intended.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple-Choice</strong>:  You will be given a set of choices, and asked to select the correct choice</li>
<li><strong>Multiple-Answer</strong>:  You will be given a set of choices, and asked to select all the correct choices</li>
<li><strong>Matching</strong>:  You will be given a list of items with input boxes in front of them.  In each box, enter the letter
    of the item in the right-hand column that matches that item</li>
<li><strong>Expression</strong>:  You will be asked to enter an algebraic expression, like "sin(x)" or "3x^2-5" or "x^2/5".  Make sure you use the
    same variables in your answer than were specified in the question.  You can press the
    "Preview" button to ensure the system is interpreting your answer the way you intended.  It will also check to
    make sure that it understands your answer, and will tell if you if the syntax is ok.</li>
<li><strong>String</strong>: You will be asked to enter a word or list of letters</li>
<li><strong>Numerical Matrix</strong>:  You will asked to enter a matrix of numbers.  In some case, a grid of input boxes will be provided
    for you to enter the values.  If not, you will need to enter the matrix in ASCIIMath notation, like [(1,2,3),(4,5,6)]
    for the 2x3 matrix with first row: 1,2,3</li>
<li><strong>Calculated Matrix</strong>:  Like a numerical matrix, but each entry can be a calculation, like 2/3 or 5^2 or sin(2).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enteringmath">Entering Math</h3>
<p>
For some types of questions, you need to enter a mathematical expression.  The system
follows order of operations, so use grouping symbols as much as necessary.
</p>
<p>Many times, you can click a yellow arrow that displays next to the answer box when you click in it, which will
open up the MathQuill equation editor, which you can use to help enter your answers.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can enter your answer using calculator-style notation. Here is some help on how to enter expressions:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>* / + -</td><td>Multiply, divide, add, subtract</td></tr>
<tr><td>^</td><td>Powers.  2^3 = 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>sqrt</td><td>Square root.  sqrt(4) = 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>( )</td><td>Parentheses, for grouping.  (2+6)/2 = 4, while 2+6/2 = 5.</td></tr>
<tr><td>e, pi</td><td>The standard constants</td></tr>
<tr><td>abs</td><td>Absolute Value.  abs(-4) = 4</td></tr>
<tr><td>sin,cos,tan,sec,csc,cot,sinh,cosh</td><td>Standard trig function.  Be sure to enter as sin(2), not sin 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>arcsin,arccos,arctan,arcsinh,arccosh</td><td>Inverse trig functions.  Note arcsec, arccsc, and arccot are not defined</td></tr>
<tr><td>sin^-1, cos^-1, tan^-1</td><td>Alternative entry for inverse trig functions.  Use like sin^-1(0.5)</td></tr>
<tr><td>ln</td><td>Natural Logarithm base e</td></tr>
<tr><td>log</td><td>Common Logarithm base 10</td></tr>
<tr><td>!</td><td>Factorial</td></tr>
<tr><td>DNE</td><td>Does Not Exist.  This is also often used for "no solutions".</td></tr>
<tr><td>oo</td><td>Infinity.  Those are two lowercase o's, like the middle of the word "look"</td></tr>
